"I am building a web app that allows users to build data analysis models using a limited set of variables and deploy these models to apply the parameters on IoT streaming data and generate triggers.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget.

"So this is what I am trying to do:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

    class Gender(Enum):
        MALE = {Pronoun.NOMINATIVE: ""He"", Pronoun.OBJECTIVE: ""Him""}

"Awesome right? I know. Let's get to the details.

TL:DR - I joined a great bunch of programmers in this slack channel linked at the bottom to learn to build MUDs as my way to learn Python+Django+Channels. Would love to chat with others that love the MUD hobby!

&nbsp;

I am still pretty new to python - about 6 months in - but am quickly getting my hands dirty. I have some experience with using Python and Django together but am really trying to get a better handle on Python before I go much further.

&nbsp;

As a fun way to learn by gamifying my experience, I am going back to my MUD roots to create an engine from scratch. Fun, I know! It's been a lot of work, and so far it really just looks like a lot of interactive fiction for one person but it's been a super fun process.

&nbsp;

The long term goal is to develop a MUD with Python while using Django+Channels as the websocket implementation. I think Channels is not super super new, but there do not seem to be to many implementations of it that I could find. At least not in tutorial form.

&nbsp;

Anyways, the main point was to introduce the idea of creating a MUD with these tools for anyone who is interested in helping or joining in a learning experience. I know I could use all the help I can get.

&nbsp;

I joined a slack of programmers that are all MUD hobbyists that work in a wide range of languages, but i am one of the few working with Python. I hope that's not a bad omen.

"Hi everyone.

I need some help figuring out how to port my tools over. I have quite a number of tools utilizing SQLite.  Then we had a change in policy that no one will have write access to the server anymore. For our code to write anything we need to use the FTP module. When I asked about the use of SQLite, I was told that I need to ""*rethink my design.*"" So SQL is out of the question since we are not running any SQL server either.

I've been too upset to tackle this task with a clear mind and I need help please :(  I will probably need to use json.

Here's 1 immediate tool I need to get working. It's a little scheduler that allows a user to book their own workstation in advance to be excluded  or included from render farm on a day by day basis. The interface displays a calendar with white background for neutral, green for including, red for excluding. This same data is read by a CRON job which fires every 15 minutes controlling the farm.  It does other things too but the most important 3 columns all live in the same table.

* date :  int  in YYMMDD format. Works really nicely I can query range of dates, before after or specific date.
* machine name
* state : include or exclude. Machines are considered neutral until they gets added to the table for that specific date.

\- having 1 json per day would be good for the CRON but horrible for user since user needs to see the calendar, there will be lots of looping to get all the data.

\- having 1 json per user  is also horrible for the CRON, again, lots of loop.

"Now you can! With the borg\_pod module / (possibly novel?) design pattern, you can change any class decorated with @assimilate into any other similarly decorated class! How does it do it? All methods with references to self (aside from those methods decorated with @resist) have self converted to self.queen, which is a sort of proxy / bridge for the 'effective' class of the borg pod.

What does it do? It maintains a state between transitions, calls the target class's \_\_new\_\_ and \_\_init\_\_ on conversion, doesn't require matching signatures for \*anything\* (meaning a completely decoupled conversion between otherwise incompatible and isolated classes) , and permits unique instances of pre-bind and post-bind borg pod classes (unlike Singleton) while maintaining a consistent ID between conversion and references to the same pod (unlike the Borg idiom). What that amounts to is that you're able to just add a decorator to your classes and cast between them! Magic methods work, inheritance works, and you can get the package through pip with pip3 install borg\_pod.

Requirements? You're gonna need Python >=3 with this implementation, and there's been no testing done on Python <3.6.  (Submit a pull request and I would be happy to fix any issues for a version of Python I don't use!)

How to use?

Just add @borg\_pod.assimilate above classes you wish to cast between, and you're good! To cast an instance into a new class, you can use YourAssimilatedClass(another\_assimilated\_instance) or pretty much any combination you can think of (queen=another\_assimilated\_instance is the keyword if you want to be explicit) without adjusting your \_\_init\_\_ signature to allow an extra input, as the queen or first instance of a queen class (\_base\_class as a \_\_new\_\_ optional kwarg, default\_class as a wrapper optional kwarg, or just the BorgPod class in borg\_pod) is removed from \*args or \*\*kwargs.

"To start, I have a BA degree with a poor background in math. I've been working at a tech company at service desk. I recently had my first interview loop for python. I've used python on my own for automating tasks, interacting with APIs, and building my own side projects (using flask, sql, plotly, etc.) 

I was feeling confident enough about my own skillset to apply for an entry-level development job at my current company. The first round went reasonably well. The interviewer gave me a programming problem that was like a riddle to solve. 

The second interviewer did the same thing, except it was way more difficult and everything he wrote on the board was in Java - I don't know Java. He was aware of this and I kept having to ask for clarification about what the code was doing and then 'interpret' that into python. I honestly did not understand the question he was asking me -fundamentally. Like, I just didn't understand what he was trying to ask. After the third time I asked him to repeat it I just pretended to understand. He practically walked me through the problem and did it for me. It was awkward 

The third interviewer came in and also asked me some really hard math riddle. It took me about 15 minutes to understand what the problem was actually about. I had no idea where to begin. He also had to essentially walk me through it and ended up writing all of the code on the board. 

I understood the code. We talked about how the functions could work. But he also told me it was kind of a trick question and that the actual answer involved using floats and modulo to get the answer. 

Cool.

The fourth interviewer cancelled on me as I had basically wasted everyone's time at this point. I went home and got very, very drunk.

I feel completely defeated. I've worked for years to learn Python and try and become a developer. I can't afford one of the expensive bootcamps. I thought I knew enough to get at least an ENTRY-LEVEL job based on what I've talked with other developers. The whole interview was essentially how well can you solve riddles using math.

Pokemon TCG Online is a game that doesn't have any keyboard shortcuts. So my application would scan the screen while PTCGO is open / in the foreground and listen for keystrokes based on context.

For example, depending on which screen you're viewing (collection, deck manager, deck editor etc.), the X button that closes a window sits in a different position, and the same key (probably Esc or backspace/delete) should be assigned to it regardless of where it is. During a match, there is no X button but there is an option to concede the game, which could use the same key as well. Also during a match the cards in your hand are always center-aligned, so every card will change position whenever you draw, play or discard any card — if the number keys are assigned to (x,y) clicks, this needs to be continually corrected for displacement.

Can Python read the screen and interpret such things? Can it listen for keystrokes  (other than terminal input)? Can it move the cursor and click places?

Unlike the assembly code generated by, say, a C or Fortran compiler, the instructions in the bytecode don't really tell me much about how well my code is written. Is a POP\_JUMP\_IF\_FALSE inside a loop a waste of cycles? Is INLINE\_ADD faster than BINARY\_ADD? Do I have potential cache misses anywhere? The kinds of insights into optimization that assembly code gives you I don't see being possible with bytecode alone, and if it is I'd love to be pointed to some examples.

​

If not, however, it begs the question: is interacting with bytecode useful at all, aside from a novelty, or curiosity?",Advantages of dealing with bytecode?,9blfk1,new
"I'm fairly new to python and programming in general, and it just hit me about five minutes ago that I'm probably doing python (and software development) wrong.

&#x200B;

Here's what happened:

I had this class FunnelSlice, with an attribute interviews\_scheduled. I went to update an instance of that class like this: 

f.interview\_scheduled = foo #(notice the missing s)

I should've written:

f.interview**s**\_scheduled = foo

My world was rocked when I realized I wasn't getting an AttributeError. I go check stack overflow and the general consensus seemed to be, ""Yes, python lets you add attributes to objects anywhere and that's a good thing."" That answer surprised me because I'm used to getting errors when my code behaves in unexpected ways.

&#x200B;

I can't be the only programmer who makes typos and errors like this. How are these kinds of stupid little mistakes avoided by professionals? Is this the kind of problem that testing is for? I've heard static analysis tools mentioned in a few places, is that something I need to be using? I use sublimetext as my editor, would something like PyCharm help me catch these kinds of problems before they happen?

Or do I just need to be more careful and somehow not make mistakes?

"I have 8 stacks of images (each stack is 1500 images) of grey scale x-ray CT images of a biological sample. If a human looks at the scan, they know what to keep for 90-99+% of the pixels. When they did the scan, I guess small artifacts or something changed the brightness a little bit for each stack. So if I try to use binarization in python or matlab or imageJ, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt for the stack depending on the threshold parameter I use. Therefore I'd have to manually threshold each stack and some images which is what we want to get away from.

&#x200B;

So my question is, is there package, where if I manually threshold say 3000 images and put the original in 1 folder and the segmented in another, an algorithm learns from that set and lets me apply it to new ones.

Currently I'm working on some python code for research where I need to fit a model on my data (pretty simple sounding). The thing is I'm using the library mpfit because today I need to make some more complicated models to fit in some cases and with mpfit you can put in your own equation for your model. Currently I'm just trying to fit my data with a simple Gaussian, and I've run into a ton of errors and when I get past one I just find another and the error messages are always unhelpful. The thing is, when I look up mpfit examples, from what I can tell they are all written for python 2.0 (as the print statements don't have parenthesis), and even the example written in the comments at the top of the code is like this. I'm starting to wonder if maybe there is a better tool for what I am trying to do and maybe mpfit is outdated?

My company has an outdated and ineffective database that is used to track customer assets for various forms of service.  We are in the process of having new software built for us, but I was not directly involved in the request, so I am having nightmares that the final product won't even be close to what we need.

The information I'm being given is that it is a VB.NET back-end communicating with a SQL Express server, and a web-based front end (asp.net I think).

With that being said, I foresee a lot of functionality that won't be present, that I would like to implement myself.  Things like utilizing python to modify fields on the server, run reports for the current status of these assets, and automate things like customer reminders.

So the question is: where do I even start?  From a broad perspective, how do these things all work together?  Can I make something like a flask web app to use SQLAlchemy, pandas, and whatever else I need?

"Yes guys you reddit right. I am working on a new Python framework called: Draper.

​

I want a framework to rapidly develop my applications without installing 100 packages and connecting them together.

Without any migrations stuff like in Django and no database handling like in Flask.

I want to have events when a model changes to bump asynchronous tasks and also store the changes (like an event store but only create, update and delete events).

​

So my first steps are the following:

* Develop CLI to create empty projects of Draper
* Write models and an ODM with a really simple layout like:

​

    class Customer(draper.model):
        name = draper.Field()
        purchases = draper.BelongsToField('Purchase')
    ​
    class Purchase(draper.Model):
       amount = draper.Field()
        customer = draper.HasOneField('Customer')

​

* Automaticly generate a REST-API from that models.
* Use celery to fire asynchronous model events and to do async stuff
* Allow developers to write custom API actions for list or detailed models views
* Create an admin frontend with react and a nice material design for the models (like in django) but also show audit logs

All in one there should be a good place for all the things, so all project layouts for Draper should be like this:

    - models          # all models are stored in here. One model per file or all in one file
    - api             # custom api views are stored in here
    - controller      # application-wide controller are stored here
    - tasks           # all asynchronous tasks should be stored in here
    - main.py         # start the main application with main.py

So the initial mechanism will look for the modules and init models or preparing the tasks

​

**What do you think?**

The features are roughly explained, surely I want to implement all the things very clean and extendable.

Anyone interesting in implementing with me or just have ideas?

* Multiple versions of the same plugin are supported (The newest one is used by default)
* Plugins can be blacklisted by type, name, or version
* Multiple plugin groups are supported so one program can use multiple sets of plugins that won't conflict
* Plugins support conditional loading (examples: os, version, installed software, etc)
* Once loaded, plugins can be accessed through dictionary or dot notation

# Step 1: Define plugin parent classes

All plugins are subclasses of parent classes. To create a parent class, use the [@Parent](https://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pluginlib.Parent) decorator.

The [@Parent](https://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pluginlib.Parent) decorator can take a plugin type for accessing child plugins of the parent. If a plugin type isn’t given, the class name will be used.

The [@Parent](https://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pluginlib.Parent) decorator can also take a `group` keyword which restricts plugins to a specific plugin group. `group` should be specified if plugins for different projects could be accessed in an single program, such as with libraries and frameworks. For more information, see the [Plugin Groups](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#plugin-groups) section.

Methods required in child plugins should be labeled as abstract methods. Plugins without these methods or with parameters that don’t match, will not be loaded. For more information, see the [Abstract Methods](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#abstract-methods) section.

​

        @pluginlib.abstractmethod
        def parse(self, string):
            pass

# 

# Step 2: Define plugin classes

Plugins can be customized through optional class attributes:

>[***\_alias\_***](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pluginlib.Plugin._alias_)  
>  
>Changes the name of the plugin which defaults to the class name.  
>  
>[***\_version\_***](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pluginlib.Plugin._version_)  
>  
>Sets the version of the plugin. Defaults to the module \_\_version\_\_ or None If multiple plugins with the same type and name are loaded, the plugin with the highest version is used. For more information, see the [Versions](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#versions) section.  
>  
>[***\_skipload\_***](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pluginlib.Plugin._skipload_)  
>  
>Boolean or method specifying if the plugin should not be loaded. This is useful when a plugin is a parent class for additional plugins or when a plugin should only be loaded under certain conditions. For more information see the [Conditional Loading](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#conditional-loading) section.

        _alias_ = 'json'
    
        def parse(self, string):
            return json.loads(string)

# 

# Step 3: Load Plugins

Plugins are loaded when the module they are in is imported. [PluginLoader](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pluginlib.PluginLoader) will load modules from specified locations and provides access to them.

[***PluginLoader***](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pluginlib.PluginLoader) ***can load plugins from several locations.***

* A program's standard library
* [Entry points](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/entry-points/)
* A list of modules
* A list of filesystem paths

Plugins can also be filtered through blacklists and type filters. See the [Blacklists](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#blacklists) and [Type Filters](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#type-filters) sections for more information.

Plugins are accessible through the [PluginLoader.plugins](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pluginlib.PluginLoader.plugins) property, a nested dictionary accessible through dot notation. For other ways to access plugins, see the [Accessing Plugins](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#accessing-plugins) section.

"I have access to the following Scientific & Computational software available at my work:

* Mathworks MATLAB
* Python
* National Instruments LabVIEW

I would like to build GUI computational apps. The apps I will create may start small but will find its way with more features in time and will need constant upgrading and deployment. I am always worried about back-compatibility issues. Apps created in Py2.7 may not work in Py3.x or vice versa and so on. But What's more important now is the best possible software I need to stick with to develop apps.

* As you all know, **LabVIEW** is formally the easiest and most straight-forward technique to build GUI Applications and deploy them. But the downside is; it requires very large size drivers that will have to be installed on host PCs. But keep all these factors aside, LabVIEW is pretty much the industry standard to create *Automated Test Systems (ATS)/ Equipment (ATE)*.

* **MATLAB** on the other hand, has a neat App designer and one may purchase the Compiler toolkit ($4250.00 perpetual license) option that will deploy a run-time file along with all dependencies on a host PC that doesn't need any prior MATLAB installations (I have no experience with *MATLAB application builder/Compiler toolkit*). The only reason why I requested a quote for *MATLAB compiler* is; the app designer looks very well furnished, and compiler SDK operation seems straight forward. But the threads (as referenced below) does claim that the app-designer has some limitations.

* **Python** is open source, great community support, and comes with more than one GUI designer tool (*QtDesigner*, Tinkter, etc). I have no experience with developing apps using *Python*. I could not find much references regarding QtDesigner's help manual or tutorials and also its limitations.

* I have two nested dictionaries (with unequal structure):
    - Dictionary 1 is my main dictionary to work on
    - Dictionary 2 specifies the keys that should be removed in Dictionary (on the same height) 1 by two different scenarios:

1. If a key in Dictionary 2 does **not** have a value, it should be removed in Dictionary 1
2. If a key has a value in Dictionary 2, it should only be removed if Dictionary 1 has the same key with the **same** value:

**Dictionary 2** specifies two keys to remove from Dictionary 1: `creationTimestamp` (on the same height) and `progressDeadlineSeconds` (on the same height), but only if the value of `600` matches in Dictionary 1.

"I wrote this implementation of a worker queue in Python for Postgres.  

I wanted a simple job queue without needing all the complexity and moving parts of RabbitMQ or Celery or similar systems.

It works like this:

* there are two tables, one table is a message queue table, the other contains the jobs to be done
* the worker code below grabs a message which contains the id of a job in the jobs table
* some work is done using the data from the job record
* if the work succeeds then the job status is set to complete
* if the work fails, the job status is set to failed, and the jobs 'attempts' field is incremented
* in either case, the queue message has now been processed and is deleted
* if you wanted to re-run failed jobs then you would add a new message back into the queue upon failure (not included in the code below)

"Warning: angry rant incoming

I've been using Python for five years now and it's been awesome. Readable syntax, memorable keywords, easy to set up and install, an amazing community, tons of documentation, a great standard library...

But no damn binary search tree - not without having to resort to some unofficial third-party module, at least.

""But Python doesn't need binary search trees because dictionaries are so blazin' fast!""

That's what some people say when the lack of BSTs are brought up. But that's not a good reason! Yes, dictionaries are awesome. Yes, hash tables are the best choice for most circumstances. No, that does not mean that it is acceptable to exclude major data structures from the standard library when other respectable langauges like C, Java, and C# give you a great pre-made BST right out of the box, no third-party imports required.

Why do I care so much? Because hash tables are really inefficient for sorted data operations. If I have a crapton of data and I want to arbitrarily be able to, say, retrieve the 5 biggest elements or traverse the collection in sorted order or anything of that nature, then I would have to sort the hash table's keys first, which would take O(nlogn) time. And yes, I can keep that sorted list in memory, but what if I add and remove some keys from the dict? Boom, now I have to re-sort the list of keys again. If I have to keep doing this over and over again it can add up to a lot of overhead. Sad!

To me, the optimal solution seems to be a self-balancing binary search tree. But self-balancing binary search trees (or B-trees, similarly) are just way too much work for a lazy dev like me to implement myself. And while I'm fine with using third party modules, it's just embarrassing and frankly terrible that such a common data structure, so essential to the world of computing, is not available in Python out of the box. Once again, nearly every language used for serious development provides this, why doesn't Python?

Maybe there is truly, honestly a very legitimate reason why Python has excluded a binary search tree implementation from its standard library. In that case, I would love to be enlightened - it is my understanding that order operations like ""get the top 5 elements"" or ""traverse the set in order"" are slow on most non-tree structures. AFAIK, Python doesn't provide any low time-complexity data structures for order operations, and while max(), sort(), and the like are really cool, they just aren't enough to make up for a lack of efficient sorting data structures.",Where's Python's damn binary search tree?,9allgh,new

"I am refactoring my codebase (I do research-oriented industry code) and had a couple questions on my filenames. This is my first python project (been working on it solo for about 2 months) and picked up the general conventions as I went along.

However, now that my codebase has gotten large enough, I wanted to ask a couple questions. I keep my functions in separate modules within a directory, such as math\_funcs.py or [window.py](https://window.py) But I name the ALL my scripts in each directory as [main.py](https://main.py).

"Hey all, I am currently using an Excel spreadsheet to track components we use at work in bed frames we make.  I am currently trying to pick up Python so I figured this would be a good application to try and learn some skills on something practical.  This really is fairly simple.  I have five styles of bed frame that use various amounts of the same components, such as screws, clamps, and metal hinges.  For instance, the Queen frame would use three metal hinges and the Twin frame would use two.  Currently, at the end of the day, I enter the number of beds shipped in the appropriate cell in Excel.  My spreadsheet will them multiply this quantity by the number listed elsewhere in the sheet quantifying how many of these hinges are used per bed frame.  It then spits out the number of these hinges and other parts that are remaining in a second column.  I manually enter these numbers to the first column and clear the numbers from the bed frames that had shipped and repeat the same process the next day.

&#x200B;

I have looked into using two options to manage this with Python.  My first option is creating some code that will determine what has been used and modify the spreadsheet using Openpyxl.  Another option is using SQLite as a small database to track these parts.  My idea is to have a command line program that asks the user how many of each bed frame has shipped, then writes the number of components remaining to the speadsheet/database as well as returning that number to the user.

            sp = ci.product

"I have some VBA code that I re-wrote in python. In python it’s an order of magnitude slower. I can’t post the exact code, but its purpose is to generate cash-flows from an excel spreadsheet of data (read into a pandas data frame). For each row a timeframe is looped through, with pandas series being instantiated.

One speedup I thought of is to scrap the series for each row and just use values or tuples. I inherently only need the current and previous value for each property so I think this might be something that would remove a lot of overhead. I wanted the input of other people before I start blindly guessing at what will speed up my code.

The overall flow is as follows:

    x = pd.read_excel(‘file.xlsx’)

"**Background:**

​I work for a small regional news organization, and was given the task to create an AI news reporting system that takes hydrocarbon well drilling data and production data, takes a small amount of human input (location to analyze, primarily), and outputs a short story highlighting 2-5 top statistical trends/observations.

​

In terms of what exists out there already, I'm aware of Narratives (and have experimented with the Microsoft PowerBI plugin, with much disappointment in the breadth of information produced), and have looked at Automated Insights (which seemed promising, but costs far too much to use effectively).

​

**The Ask:**

1. Are there any existing Python (or other) projects anyone has seen available open source that extract data trends and observations from a dataset?
2. Are there any existing Python libraries or web API's that use basic AI to change word choice from a formulaic text blurb, so that the exact same story isn't being reported every day?  Ideally, this would be a web API where a story is submitted to, and various possible word choice changes are suggested.
3. **Most Important:** What are some interesting statistics that can be drawn from a list of every oil/gas well drilled in the past decade?  Looking at year-to-year growth, comparing growth between different locations, comparing oil-to-gas growth ratio, etc. are some considerations I've had.  Does anyone have anything else creative?

I'm open to any advice and suggestions anyone can provide, and am excited to see what ideas anyone has!

"Hi guys,

I haven’t been posting in this subreddit for a while, but now I want to publish this because of an experiment that we’ve recently made on [CheckiO](https://py.checkio.org/). I think it was a pretty successful one and I hope that the post itself is not going to be banned as a spam or an ad.

First, a little bit of history. For the last couple of years I was teaching Python-basics in my hometown in Ukraine. When we went into such basic subjects as ints, lists, creating functions and so on, I was using CheckiO as a platform for home-work. 

At the same time I’ve always struggled with OOP coding challenges, where a user had to create a specific class. We didn’t have these kinds of missions on CheckiO, and non of the coding-games that I know had them as well, so I simply come up with a series of challenges outside of CheckiO and my students had to share the results by email.

The idea of those challenges is as follows.

In the first mission you need to create a class Warrior, and the instances of that class can fight each other by using the fight function. Then you need to create a class Army, which has different warriors in it. After that you have to create other types of units, such as the defender, vampire and healer. And then you need to create a class Weapon, and so on and so forth.

Eventually, we’ve had a list of 10 missions and we’ve decided to find a way to migrate those missions to CheckiO, and [we did it, along with publishing a series of articles on OOP in Python.](https://py.checkio.org/blog/object-oriented-programming-checkio/)

Let me know what do you think about all of it? Maybe you have more ideas for other OOP missions or a new OOP Series. ",Object Oriented Programming with CheckiO,98uenn,new

"I have a successfully working numpy random generator for D&D that I am trying to run. I currently have the following code. I am trying to get it to assign statArray\[i\] to the Stat that is rolled for each len(statGroup).

In another section of the program, it is asking for the chosen class and will automatically assign the max statArray to the Primary Stat, and I believe I know how to make that work. I just don't know how to get the following:

`statArray[i] = sum(diceRolls) - min(diceRolls)`

to be saved to each item in the statArray (stat1, stat2, etc). In the output below, I don't know how to save the final numbers to each statArray, so 13 would go to stat1.

Does anyone have any idea how I can accomplish this? I hope that I worded it clearly enough.

`import numpy as np`

`print(""Stats have been rolled."")`

`statArray = [""stat1"",""stat2"",""stat3"",""stat4"",""stat5"",""stat6""]`

`statGroup = [""Strength"",""Dexterity"",""Constitution"",""Intelligence"",""Wisdom"",""Charisma""]`

`i = 0`

`while i < len(statGroup):`

`rolls=[1,2,3,4,5,6]`

`diceRolls = np.random.choice(rolls,4, replace=True)`

`diceRolls.sort()`

`print(diceRolls)`

`statArray[i] = sum(diceRolls) - min(diceRolls)`

`## statArray[i] = Stat[i]`

`print(statGroup[i], statArray[i])`

`print(statArray[i])`

`i+=1`

**Output:**

Stats have been rolled.

**Edit: If it would be easier, we could add the sum(diceRolls) - min(diceRolls) to an array of its own and I can just sort it ASC so that I can grab the array number and pair it to each stat?**

**\[11,11,11,13,15,16\] as the output for statRolls and I can just grab an index from each one to pair to a stat? I hope that this is all making some kind of sense. In my head, it makes sense.**","Assign List[i] = rollList[i] (Numpy, assign value to a list in order)",98tmfv,new

But still, in my script that uses pyodbc, PyCharm underlines pyodbc in red, and when I hover my mouse over it, it tells me ""module not found"".  On my Settings | Project Interpreter screen, it shows that pyodbc is installed, and when I run my script, it works.  

My problem is that it doesn't show me function arguments when I type a function name and the open parenthesis, as it does for modules that it knows about.

"Hi

tl;dr: Should I learn Go or Rust to make Python run heavy and parallel computations faster?

I'm planning to learn a new language with an intention to use it to speed up Python at heavy computation or, especially, when some parallel computations would be beneficial. 

Off-course, I also just want to learn a new language just to broaden my horizons. I do not need to use it to extend Python right away, but I'd like to have a possibility to use this language in the future when the speed of Python or a way that it uses threads would not be good enough for me.

but it's 4 years old, and there's not much about Go and Rust mentioned in comments, it's mostly about C and C++, and I'd like to learn one of those two new and modern languages anyway, so it does not answer my question.

Something about me: I mostly code in Python, but sometimes also in C++, I'm not really interested in webservices or web-related technologies, I know, that if I would be, then Go would be probably a better solution.

"## Dependency Injector 3.13.1 has been released!

[Dependency Injector](https://github.com/ets-labs/python-dependency-injector) 3.13.1 has been released!

**Changelog**

* Add Python 3.7 support.
* Drop Python 3.3 support.
* Drop Python 2.6 support.
* Add example of “Chained Factories” pattern.
* Add example of “Factory of Factories” pattern.

**""Chained Factories"" pattern**

Main idea of this pattern is about wrapping Factory into other Factory that mix additional arguments or keyword arguments to a wrapped one ([Full example](http://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/examples/chained_factories.html)): 

    database = providers.Factory(SqlAlchemyDatabaseService, session=session)

"Been creating more recipes for the [PySimpleGUI Cookbook](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook/#multiple-columns).

One fun one is the one-line GUI.  It's possible to string together all of the statements in this simple GUI:

[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/44227935-ecb53b80-a161-11e8-968b-b3f963404dec.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/44227935-ecb53b80-a161-11e8-968b-b3f963404dec.jpg)

This is the code:

    import PySimpleGUI as sg

    layout = [[sg.Text('Filename')],
          [sg.Input(), sg.FileBrowse()],
          [sg.OK(), sg.Cancel()] ]

    button, (number,) = sg.FlexForm('Get filename example').LayoutAndRead(layout)

These all collapse down into a single line (not counting the import of course):

    import PySimpleGUI as sg

    button, (filename,) = sg.FlexForm('Get filename example'). LayoutAndRead([[sg.Text('Filename')], [sg.Input(), sg.FileBrowse()], [sg.OK(), sg.Cancel()] ])

This line of code will display your custom GUI, get the results from the user, and store the result in the user variables `button` and `filename`, ready for use by the program.   Not the most readable code mind you, but if you want compact, it's hard to beat that line for what it does.

The goal of this package is to take away the pain of creating a GUI so you can concentrate on USING the data collected from the user rather.

"I want to create a custom editing application for a database of mine so I don't have to deal directly with the SQL tables when I need to do any advanced edits (such as add/edit/delete various template records).  I presently have a pure looping/readline interface that covers about 90% of the work I need to do, but the remaining 10%, as they say, takes the other 90% of the time when I'm using the DB.

With that preface, I'm trying to decide which (using the terms loosely here) curses wrapper I should use for the DB editor?  

Features I'm looking at are:

* Ability to handle lists (or otherwise have multi-line textboxes)
* Possibility of a two-column interface
* Ability to have a listener for F-key presses (for prev/next or reverting changes)
* Quality of tutorial docs.

Without further ado, here are the results I found and my thoughts on them—can you let me know which option I should pick or if any of my thoughts are inaccurate?

* **Cursebox**—too little documentation for me to make an informed decision
* **urwid**—I really wanted this to be the frontrunner, but the tutorial-style documentation is sorely lacking.  Probably overkill for what I need.
* **npyscreen**—seems to be able to do what I want besides possibly easily creating two-column UIs
* **ASCIImatics**—even has a DB editing UI right there in the tutorial, so it's the current frontrunner (but I'll need to dig deeper to check on ease of F-key listening and two-column possibilities)
* **Python Prompt Toolkit**—seems very flexible from the featured projects tab, but also not quite for the use cases I need at the moment.

"So I have a texture that I need to display to the user, get the user to select 4 points and then prospective correct that image. I have that part down and working.

The problem is that the texture is loaded OpenGL style (0,0 as BL) but that is not natural for the user. I can easily flip the texture VISUALLY but my selection coordinates are still referencing the OpenGL BL coordinate space. If I can invert the selection coordinates that will effectively bring both into alignment and the correct section of the texture will be isolated.

Texture coordinates are in your typical `u, v, u + w, v, u + w, v + h, u, v + h` as a relative number of the rendered display and you can simpily flip your `h` to get the inversion. The problem is the above asumes its a rectangular selection and yet I have a quad who's every corner coord would have a different `w, h`.

I have been racking my brain for a way to do this and come up short. My current method takes `display_size[]` and `selection_coords[]` zips them together while doing `selection / size` to get the relative value. This works for selcting the correct part of the image when both on the OpenGL BL coordinate system.

Is there an existing matrix or something I can use to get the relatives out of AND inverted all together, or at a minimum a way to get the inversion of my relatives?

First of all.... no len on `_grouper`. 

Second of all, the `_grouper` iterable(i'm aware it's not technically an iterable), if you cast it to a list to check it's length for the first point, it is no longer iterable.

I find the google API documentation a little chaotic to be honest, and I'm having doubts if my current approach is the best solution.

The login part is copied from the ""tutorial"" on the google's API page itself:

    store = file.Storage('token.json')
    creds = store.get()
    if not creds or creds.invalid:
        flow = client.flow_from_clientsecrets('credentials.json', SCOPES)
        creds = tools.run_flow(flow, store)
    service = build('gmail', 'v1', http=creds.authorize(Http()))

Then I used this instruction to get the list of email messages:

    results = service.users().messages().list(userId='me').execute()

Then I retrieve the various IDs and for each one I load the payload with:

    payload = email['payload']['body']['data']

The payload is encoded in Base64 so for printing it I've used:

    print(base64.b64decode(payload))

The problem is that it seems that only a part of the message is correctly displayed, the rest is garbage. I don't think it's an issue with pycharm itself since the same base64 string decoded on an online website gives me the same result.

"Hello everyone!

I want to ask you for feedback for my project - XDump - a utility to make a consistent partial dump and load it into the database.

A few years ago I faced with a problem - I needed a data from the production database to reproduce a bug locally. Back then the table had a single FK to another table, and they both were small, so I just dumped these 2 tables with \`pg\_dump -t first -t second\` and it worked fine. However, after some time, the schema became more complex, the database size grew dramatically, and it was taking too much time to accomplish the task. It wasn't possible to load fewer tables, because such dump cannot be loaded due referential integrity issues - referenced rows should exist in the database.

At some point, I decided to create a utility for making integral, consistent DB dumps, that include only what is needed to reproduce some production issue locally.

**FEATURES**:

\- Automatic loading of referenced objects (recursive and non-recursive relations)

\- Control what to include via SQL queries - \`SELECT \* FROM employees WHERE first\_name = 'John'\`

\- Supports PostgreSQL 9.4 - 10.4 and SQLite >= 3.8.3

\- DB re-creation / tables truncation before loading the dump

\- Django integration

**UPCOMING:**

\- MySQL support

\- Loading of rows that reference certain rows

"I'm a bit stumped by a problem I've encountered, but since its a bit complicated I figured I would ask here instead of /r/learnpython.  If this is mistaken, please let me know and I'll repost there.  I'll also preface this by mentioning that I'm more of an IT admin than a developer and this is the first major program I've worked on in decades, but other than a few less and efficient issues here and there its pretty sturdy (doesn't hurt that a lot of its basic if/then type stuff).


To set the stage:

We have a number of voicemail servers that each hold a *significant* number of mailboxes.   The systems have a REST API that I can use to query data, however there are a couple of restrictions:

* I can collect basic details for a large number of mailboxes at once
* However I must perform 2-3 more queries *per mailbox* to collect the additional details I require for my needs.

The sheer number of mailboxes requires the data be collected in a multithreaded process (I calculated it would take 14 hours to get everything if I did it all sequentially).  I also went this way since the issue is more about waiting for a reply than needing extra horsepower to process data.  I start by opening 8 threads, assigning a server to each, and grab the basic details for each mailbox, then open 5 sub-threads to query the specific details of each mailbox.

I have two machines I run this code on:

* A mid-tier laptop with a dual core i7 cpu, 16GB RAM, and a SSD used as my development environment.
* A desktop with 2x 16 core Xeon E5 cpus, 16GB RAM, and a standard platter disk used as the production environment.

When I run my code on the dev laptop it takes about an 1-1.5 hours to complete, however when I run the same code on my production desktop it takes 4 hours.  I was able to find some posts mentioning issues like this might have to do with processes hoping from one cpu to the other losing direct access to data in cache, so I ran while forcing CPU affinity to one socket and it only took 3 hours - an improvement, but still a ways to go.

At this point I'm sort of at a loss for where to look next.  I did think about perhaps implementing multiprocessing so each thread gets its own process as well, but didn't really want to spend the time to research how to do this and refactor my code if it wasn't going to make much of a difference.

"Hey gang.  I am have been looking for a way to process a large collection of images that I have.  I run a website written in Python 2.7 / Django 1.11.  This website features an image database.  The number of images is quite large and is added to frequently. My backend updates the image database (which itself only contains metadata and a path to the image file) once a week on mondays at 2AM, so I am not super concerned about resource hogging.

I was wondering if anyone was aware of any libraries that would allow me to extract descriptive keywords about each image based solely on the image and not on any metadata.  I've used NN to process images in the past for OCR and things of that nature, so I know it's possible, but I was hoping there was a model that had been trained to handle that kind of thing.

I don't need a high level of detail.  For example, if I had a picture of a man holding a plate of very tasty nachos while jumping on a trampoline in the grand canyon, I would be happy if it could pick out nachos/food and man.  Anything else would be a bonus.

Are there any resources out there that you are aware of that might be helpful for this task?

"Hi Folks,

Just a quick note to let you know that **SQLAthanor v.0.3.0** has just been released. The library provides extensive serialization/de-serialization support for SQLAlchemy models (to/from CSV, JSON, YAML, and Python dict).

This release is mostly new features, including:

* De-serialization methods and functions now accept paths (to files containing serialized data) as well as strings.
* Programmatic generation of Declarative Base Model's based on serialized data (e.g. generate a `BaseModel` based on a JSON object).
* Programmatic generation of Table objects based on serialized data (e.g. generate a SQLAlchemy `Table` based on a JSON object).
* Added convenient ""serialize everything"" methods (e.g. `dump_to_json()` to Declarative Base Models).
* Added a public method to support serialization/de-serialization re-configuration.

"This was my first project in MeteorJS and I'm mildly pleased with how it turned out.

I just thought about how we have some websites that offer collaborative coding and executing of code in browser and they generally require you to make an account and pay for subscription, and I have no problem with that.

However, I thought it would be cool if you could just launch your own collaborative coding environment and send the link to the interviewee/student/friend and then you're not required to log-in or pay for anything, it just uses the resources of your machine and that's it.

That's how I came up with Copad: [https://github.com/mshvern/copad](https://github.com/mshvern/copad)  
A tool that lets you launch your own collaborative coding environment with just two lines of Docker commands.

It executes Javascript in the browser of the person who pressed ""execute"" and logs the output of ""console.log"" and similar commands to an output box (which is synchronized between all the users of the application).

Security is not a goal, since this is intended for local use, but it's relatively okay, because all the code is launched in the embedded iframe and the whole server is ran as docker after all.

Currently it supports Javascript and Python (through Brython), it's still somewhat early in development and I'm considering moving to another platform from MeteorJS, since the size of the Docker image is too big.  


Any suggestions? Should I move this to something like Tornado? ",I wrote a portable collaborative code environment for browsers and it supports Python (thanks to Brython),967ehp,new

Every course is like 55 to 70 slides and I don't have the motivation to go through and screenshot every single one.

"Sorry if this is a bit noobish, I learned python in order to work on this project, I'm still a bit of a novice.

For the project in question, I need to iterate over some very large lists and make some even larger lists.  I originally used lists, found it too clumsy to deal with (for spreadsheets ranging from 1800x9 to 597,000 x 3) so I made a class to warehouse the items from the spreadsheets and iterated over a list containing a pointer to all of the objects.  I have a function that every item in one column has to be ran through, this function will preform a series of splits, regex expressions and other text manipulations, potentially creating new strings for each operation.  These strings are saved and used in another function.

So, here's the issue, when I ran this yesterday, it took 45 minutes to complete.  I'm not really fond if sitting there for 45 minutes waiting on my laptop to do something.  Since I like using print statements to watch where execution is, I know where the bottleneck is, it's the function I described above.

In an attempt to solve this problem, I've been experimenting with a few things, but I don't actually know of a great deal that I can do.  I started up a new jupyter notebook and tried to see what runs faster, comprehension or for loop.  I figured the comprehension.  Well, % didn't work for the for loop so I moved on to the next one.  I compared a list comprehension to a compiled list comprehension.  Huge surprise to me, the comprehension was faster than compiling it first.

%time\[(random.randint(1, 101)\*y) for x in range(1000) for y in range(x)\]CPU times: user 5.65 s, sys: 40.1 ms, total: 5.69 s Wall time: 5.69 s

c = compile('\[(random.randint(1, 101)\*y) for x in range(1000) for y in range(x)\] ', 'stuff', 'exec')%time exec(c)CPU times: user 5.74 s, sys: 20.1 ms, total: 5.76 s Wall time: 5.78 s  


Does anyone know why the compiled statement took longer to run than the comprehension?  Anyone have any other tips for what I can do to speed things up?  I'm looking into maybe converting some of the comprehension parts into lambdas, I'll have to test the speed on that to see if that will help or not.  


Any tips here would be appreciated.

    from dataclasses import dataclass, asdict

         example: bool = True
    
    @dataclass

Submitted a bug report [here](https://bugs.python.org/issue34363). Check it out if you want to know how and why this happens!

Write up below:

In Python 3.7, `dataclasses` were added to make a few programming use-cases easier to manage.

Dataclasses eliminate boilerplate code one would write in Python <3.7.

	# Python 3.6
    class Example:
        def __init__(self, val1: str, val2: str, val3: str):
        	self.val1 = val1
        	self.val2 = val2
        	self.val3 = val3

    example = Example(""here's"", ""an"", ""example"")

This code can be rewritten, like so:

	# Python 3.7
	from dataclasses import dataclass, asdict

	@dataclass
	class Example:
		val1: str
		val2: str
		val3: str

	example = Example(""here's"", ""an"", ""example"")


Dataclasses provide us with automatic comparison dunder-methods, the ability make our objects mutable/immutable and the ability to decompose them into dictionary of type `Dict[str, Any]`. 

Let's see that in action:

	from dataclasses import dataclass, asdict

	@dataclass
	class Example:
		val1: str
		val2: str
		val3: str

	example = Example(""here's"", ""an"", ""example"")
	print(asdict(example))
	>>> {'val1': ""here's"", 'val2': 'an', 'val3': 'example'}


What happens when you compose a `dataclass` with a `namedtuple`?

    from dataclasses import dataclass, asdict
	from typing import NamedTuple


	class NamedTupleAttribute(NamedTuple):
	    example: bool = True


	@dataclass
	class Data:
	    attr: NamedTupleAttribute

	data = Data(NamedTupleAttribute(example=True))
	namedtuple_attr = asdict(data)['attr']
	print(namedtuple_attr.example)
	>>> <generator object _asdict_inner.<locals>.<genexpr> at 0x107f45408>


Whoa, there! Shouldn't `data.attr.example` be of type `bool`? Why does `namedtuple_attr.example` evaluate to a generator expression?

To answer those questions, we'll need to look at a few things. First, `tuple` vs `namedtuple` factories and then `asdict()`'s  implementation.

`tuple()` takes an iterable as its only argument and exhausts it while building a new object. However, `namedtuple()` takes arbitrarily many arguments and does not exaust generators supplied as arguments.


    print(tuple(x for x in range(5)))
    >>> (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

    print(NamedTupleAttribute(x for x in range(5)))
    >>> NamedTupleAttribute(example=<generator object <genexpr> at 0x107f45318>)

Where does this fit in with `asdict()`? We'll need to look at its implementation to understand.

    
	def asdict(obj, *, dict_factory=dict):
	    if not _is_dataclass_instance(obj):
	        raise TypeError(""asdict() should be called on dataclass instances"")
	    return _asdict_inner(obj, dict_factory)

	def _asdict_inner(obj, dict_factory):
	    if _is_dataclass_instance(obj):
	        result = []
	        for f in fields(obj):
	            value = _asdict_inner(getattr(obj, f.name), dict_factory)
	            result.append((f.name, value))
	        return dict_factory(result)
	    elif isinstance(obj, (list, tuple)):
	        return type(obj)(_asdict_inner(v, dict_factory) for v in obj) # right here
	    elif isinstance(obj, dict):
	        return type(obj)((_asdict_inner(k, dict_factory), _asdict_inner(v, dict_factory))
	                          for k, v in obj.items())
	    else:
	        return copy.deepcopy(obj)


`_asdict_inner()` will pass a generator to objects that are of type `tuple`, expecting them to be consumed by the tuple factory.

`typing.NamedTuple` and `collections.namedtuple()` are of type `tuple`, but override its `__new__` functionality.

Here's what happens when `asdict()` is called on a `dataclass` that has a `namedtuple`:

1. `_asdict_inner()` recurses on the dataclass object's fields
2. When it reaches a field with the type `tuple`, it calls the object-type's constructor with a generator expression of fields.
3. If it's a `tuple`, the generator expression is exhausted and a tuple with the generator's values is produced.
4. If it's a `NamedTuple`, the anonymous generator expression object is not iterated over and is assigned as a field on the `NamedTuple`.
5. `asdict()` returns a new `Dict[str, Any]` with malformed `NamedTuple`s.

Both Eric V. Smith and Ivan Levkivskyi have [both graciously proposed solutions to this issue](https://bugs.python.org/issue34363).

Ivan Levkivskyi has [suggested](https://bugs.python.org/msg323300) that `_asdict_inner` apply a generator expression only to the standard libraries types `list` and `tuple`, then allowing `NamedTuples` to follow the branch that becomes deep-copied. 

Eric Smith proposed [a solution](https://bugs.python.org/msg323312) in which the generator expression is *expanded* with star-notation as it is passed in the tuple factory method.

"I've been working on a project involving embedding Python into a Windows application. I've got all of that working fine on the C++ side, but the script side seems to be hitting a dead end with multiprocessing. When my script tries to run the same multiprocessing code that works in a non-embedded environment, the code doesn't appear to be executed at all.

[This SO thread ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15636266/embedded-python-multiprocessing-not-working)gave me a few ideas to try out, so I gave it a shot with these lines:

    sys.argv = ['C:\\path\\to\\script.py']
    mp.set_executable(""C:\\Python37\\python.exe"")
    p = mp.Process(target=somefunction)
    p.start()

Still no joy. However, a Python.exe window does pop up for a tenth of a second, so *something* is happening.

So does multiprocessing actually work in embedded Python, or am I at a dead end here?

**EDIT**:

 I found a minor workaround, but I don't quite understand why it works this way or how I would fix it to work differently.

My program runs one script file, and multiprocessing commands from that script file seem to fail to spawn new processes.   
However, if that script file calls a function in a separate script file that it has imported, and that function calls multiprocessing functions, it all works exactly the way it should. 

So now I think my question is why does it behave this way, and is there anything I can do to fix the behavior in the first script? It's not the end of the world to need 2 scripts, but it sure would be a lot cleaner with just one.  ",Embedded Python and multiprocessing on Windows?,95rkgm,new

For the concurrency, the Global Interpreter Locker impose heavy limits on the use of Python for cpu-bound multithreading.

The problem: I'm getting a stream of packed data apparently created on a machine with a 30-bit word (""The formats...consist of 8 words, each containing 30 bits""). For instance, here's the first 5 fields:

    A: bits 1-13
    B: bits 14-17
    C: bits 18-26
    D: bits 27-30
    E: bits 31-34

You see fields are falling across what would normally be considered byte boundaries. It gets worse farther on, for a total of 240 bits. This makes using `struct.unpack()` or `ctypes` an issue. Even if you turn on the `_pack_` feature, you can't have a bitfield fall across a word boundary.

What I'd love to do is just read the entire 240 bits into a long binary buffer and mask out the exact bits I want. There doesn't seem to be such a data structure in Python 2.x (or 3.x?). 

My next idea is to simulate the above. Put the 240 bits into a string. Select a chunk of bytes that contain those bits. Use `struct.unpack()` to read the bytes and then create a mask to get just those bits. Some shifting involved there. It's hairy and hasn't worked yet after a couple hours of work.

"df=pandas.read_excel(Filename, dtype=Str)





The above code reads Filename as string but if there is a single entry with 5% let's say. Then pandas reads it as '0.05' even though I have stated the dtype as string. It first converts to float and then makes it into a string.



How do I ensure that pandas reads it as 5%


On a side note. It reads fine if I have an entry that is 'calcium 4%'. The issue is only with number followed by percentage

"[Documentation here](https://animatplot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

**What it is:**

animatplot is a library for more easily producing animated plots. It was built with the goal of making animated plots as easy as static ones. Just feed it data. No dealing with how stuff updates. More time should be spent on the data; not the plotting. Bonus: this library lets you easily add time sliders and pause buttons. This does come at a cost of memory usage (all data must be generate before any plotting not on the fly), but even for a detailed plot it should not be too bad (I made an animated pcolormesh plot with a 100,000 frames without any issue).

Here is a gif of an example:

https://i.redd.it/evfgjj31rle11.gif

If that wasn't a gif. The slider and pause button would work exactly as expected.

**Why I built it:**

I'm a physics/math student, and I've frequently found myself needing to make all sorts of animated plots. Generally things that are solutions to PDEs (light waves, heat equation, etc.). Many of my peers have struggled to produce these animation often resorting to simply clearing and redrawing plots every frame. It can also be useful for displaying iterations of a numerical method to more clearly see if it is working as expected. Ultimately, I saw a need, so I wrote this.

**What I learned writing this:**

I already knew a bit about packaging from a [previous project](https://github.com/t-makaro/nb_pdf_template), but that was a set of templates, not a library, but I still learned a lot about things like how to use a `_version.py` file to have a single location for the version. Mostly, I learned how to document code (using sphinx). I also learned a lot about how matplotlib works (luckily I never had to read any of the c code, only python). I also submitted a fix to matplotlib slated for matplotlib version 3.1. This has also really changed the way that I use matplotlib.

**Near future plans:**

animatplot is built using ""blocks"" to represent ""things"" that are to be animated. I currently have plans for scatter plot and annotation blocks. I plan to move the gallery to use sphinx-gallery once they add support for custom image scrappers. (Sphinx-gallery devs have really been hard at work to finish some stale PRs since I asked about animation support.) I also really need to improve the Pcolormesh block api since it's just not as capable as I would like.

Edit: Perhaps I should mention how long I've been working on this. I originally started this over a year ago, but I have completely rewritten everything and then some, and made the documents in the last month and a bit. The only thing that is the same from the original project is the internal logic for the play/pause button. Matplotlib 2.2 introduced discreet slider bars which inspired (and was critical to) much of the implementation.

Edit 2: Wow, thank you everyone for the positive feedback. Sorry for the packaging issue (damn editable install didn't catch that). It's fixed in version 0.2.2.",Introducing animatplot: Making interactive animated plots with matplotlib easy (my first library),958ulo,new

* The first is that I've got the scaling of the contour information off, it's probably flipped around the wrong way somehow. I've played around with flipping the lon/lats and changing the resolution variable, but no good has come from it.

* The second is that I'm missing resolution information for the contours, as the population circles cover the map, but I have very limited contour information. Only about four of so contours, other than the ones mentioned about there are some others in northern Russia for some reason...

"I'm trying to set up build/deploy infrastructure for a pipenv project using Docker. Right now, I'm just copying everything into the container and running `pipenv install [flags]`; however, this is really slow (like 10 minutes) and Docker's caching mechanism isn't Python-aware, so it reruns the `pipenv install` every time any of the source code changes (Docker reruns everything after a COPY instruction).

The obvious workaround is to create a separate base image with just the dependencies--this would just copy in the pipfile and pipfile.lock, and we could just rebuild this image if either of those files have changed; however, this falls over because our pipfile also makes reference to sibling directories in the same repository (the repository contains binary projects as well as library projects that the binary depends on).

My regex is REALLY long so I won't paste it here, but basically I have a parameter definition string that looks like (simplified):

"TL;DR

How do I load many images onto a tkinter widget without freezing the application?

Hey folks,

I had a question about how to build a large list of images in a Tkinter widget without freezing the main application. As of right now, the application is built using classes (as commonly seen in places like StackExchange) and works quite nicely.

Once the program boots up, the user selects a directory. The program will then look at all the images in that directory and create labels whose image is a thumbnail version of one of those images. Unfortunately, it takes a long time to generate a large amount of images. Because of that, I would like to try and run the loading in a separate process.

So far, the closest I have gotten to a solution is by using the after call. Here is a snippet of some of my code:

    def insertImgs(widget, images, numColumns=3, scale=0.1):
        def step():
            img = createTkImg(imgPath)
            label = tk.Label(widget, image=img)
            label.grid(row=i//numColumns, column=i%numColumns)
            # Generate a configure event to update the scrollbar of the
            # widget otherwise the user has to resize the app before
            # the scrollbar is usable
            widget.event_generate('<Configure>', when='tail')
            widget.update_idletasks()
            widget.after(0, nextStep)
            yield

        nextStep = step().__next__
        widget.after(0, nextStep)

This code works almost perfectly but it will raise a StopIteration exception. I can't use try/except because it is the Tkinter library actually calling nextStep, not me. I use update_idletasks and event_generate so that the images can pop up as they are loaded rather than show them all once the last image has been loaded. I have tried this without update_idletasks and event_generate but that did not work.

I have also tried using the multiprocessing library but that does not work because it appears that Tkinter objects are not pickleable.

I would really appreciate some guidance on this as I have been banging my head against this problem for a couple weeks now.

One of the most beautiful thing I personally find in MATLAB is how their IDE is optimized. Nothing fancy, just neat, clean and robust. Large data files can easily be loaded into it and you can plot selective data from those. It just makes visualization and understanding the data so much easier.

If Python came with a full pledged IDE like MATLAB, I would just buy it. Are there any editors that allows workspace variables; where you can select the data and plot it just by selecting the columns. That is all I am lacking now in Pycharm, also storing the variable values just like in MATLAB.

"I have had this long running project idea but I may be in way over my head.

Here's the synopsis - I have a classic VW Beetle with a high performance engine and with that comes the need to be aware of any issues that may be developing. So I began looking into monitoring and data logging solutions. I found that the solutions available had either system limitations (required OBD-II) or cost stupid amounts of money ($1,000+).

So here comes my DIY spirit and drive to learn more programming. I decided on the Raspberry PI as the platform - for several reasons availability of resources and accessories being chief. Inputs will be 5 temperature sensors, 1 oil pressure sensor, 2 EGT sensors and a tachometer. Primarily needs to have the ability to log data and display it either through a basic warning light or through a series of LEDs that progressively turn on based on engine temps. Planing on later adding a digital dashboard that would graphically display the different inputs. There is my pie in the sky.

Reality. I have very limited programming experience, mostly in script languages (VBA, AHK) but also some basic SQL. I buy the Raspberry Pi get it up and running tinker with native apps. Also purchased thermopouples, breakout  boards, a small 4x5 LED matrix, breadboards and jumper cables. Jumped in and got things soldered and started programming. I figured I would break out each part, get that functional and put it all together down the road. I started with one thermocouple - it took me almost 2 hours to get temperature readings, another 30 minutes to trouble shoot erroneous data I was getting and another hour to add a second thermocouple. So now I have a short program that will display sensor readings 2x a second but it's not being saved or later review.

Give me a reality check is this a way too ambitious project? Based on how long it took me to get the temp sensors running is it going to take days and days to get that input into a file and saved and even longer to turn on LEDs?",Project Idea - may need a reality check,940q3c,new
"I have a script written out that collects data from remote sensors (raspberry pi and arduino) and then posts the info. I am having trouble only making the main loop or script run if it is between 6am and 9pm.
I had the script running off crontab every 15 minutes but for the way it is reading serial information it would be nice to just always have the script running and have the main loop only run between certain times. Ideas? 

My idea would be to have a crontab at 6am to create a text file and then another crontab at 9pm to delete the file. I should then be able to use a while file exists loop. Anyone have a better way?

"Hi All,

I'm looking for advice on tooling/approaches to use for a task.

I want to display entries of a database to end-users that allow them to view the rows and have some columns be editable. By editing the values, it would then write back to the database and save.

Basically it would function like a big shared excel document (row x column) except the core data is stored in a database and only certain columns can be edited. This would also require some filters for end-users to narrow their search.

How would you go about this?

I've been asked to assemble a pretty simple site for my local community. I've built plenty of sites in the past using horrible WordPress and some less awful things like lumen/laravel. That being said, I like py.. I want to make it with py..


It doesn't need much, will just be a place for collating info from meetings, FAQs, contact details, picture galleries.. An event calendar, maybe a few contact forms.. No user logins etc..


My requirements are:
- needs WYSIWYG editor for the less technical editors (my wife).. Picture upload also a must!
- active community with some themes to pick from so I won't need to dive into front end much hopefully (I'm all about the backbend in my professional life(devops))
- would be great if I could integrate discus for comments (there will be a discus subdomain also for the actual community to talk on).. Oauth2 based.
- I would prefer flat file to a fancy database.. I will host it on kubernetes so I could manage postgres if I need to, I'd just rather not I guess.. Happily either way tho but prefer less ops in general.
- secure (the reason I don't like WordPress et al) with frequent updates?



I've come across mezzanine, which looks OK but I'm not finding many themes etc and every tutorial I can find is like 5 years old.. Surely there's something I've missed? Is the python web eco system really this... erm...minimal? I guess php is OK I just haven't enjoyed managing things like WordPress in my past, especially because I like knowing things are reasonably secure and I don't want to dedicate an entire host to something.

"Update: Found the issue, it was in how `timeit` works. Go to the subheading `Solution`

So I was trying to investigate differences between `+=` and `extend` in lists, but while investigating, I noticed something odd.
    
    Summary Table
    N/method              1000    10000    100000
    ----------------  --------  -------  --------
    og = og + other   0.0303    0.352      4.08
    hi = og + other   0.000429  0.00538    0.0806
    og += other       0.000446  0.00517    0.0569
    og.extend(other)  0.000467  0.00552    0.0566

Where `og` and `other` are lists, while N represents how large the list is. 

I.e. reusing one of the lists in the addition results in a massive slowdown (2 orders of magnitude). 

Does anyone know why this is the case?

My first intuition is that it's the timeit module to blame here, but this is really odd behaviour. 

### Appendix

    1000 loops, best of 3: 3.47 msec per loop


# Solution

OK I've found the issue. I went and had a look at `timeit` since I was certain that's where the problem was.

    def timeit(self, number=default_number):
        """"""Time 'number' executions of the main statement.

        To be precise, this executes the setup statement once, and
        then returns the time it takes to execute the main statement
        a number of times, as a float measured in seconds.  The
        argument is the number of times through the loop, defaulting
        to one million.  The main statement, the setup statement and
        the timer function to be used are passed to the constructor.
        """"""
    

So in this case, `list1=list1+list2`, list1 was constantly growing in size each time by `N`. So after j iterations we'd create a new list of size (j+1)N which was obviously much slower since += and extend only cared about the size of list2 (N). If i had done 10 runs and 1000 repeats I'd have gotten a different result haha. 

In fact my script gives a 100x magnitude issue while the one liners give 1000x magnitude, simply due to the number of runs done

Adding `l1=list1` in the setup and rerunning the code

    ➜  python3 timeCode.py
    Summary Table
    N/method                             1000    10000

    list1 = list1 + list2; list1=l1  0.000427  0.00524

"Could someone clarify exactly what each pipenv command is doing.

These are my observations so far over the last few months of usage, some of which may be wrong on my part.  I'm on the very latest version just to clarify and I've even tried installing directly from master in case there are missing bug fixes.

* Pipfile without Pipfile.lock
   * `pipenv install`: This works as expected, pulling down packages that satisfy any constraints into the venv, and creating a lock file
* Pipfile (all packages are ""\*"") with Pipfile.lock 
   * `pipenv install my_pkg`: Adds my\_pkg to the Pipfile, pulls package into venv, updates lock file. Sounds good to me.
   * `pipenv install`: This looks like it updates any outdated packages by default? I would have expected this to use Pipfile.lock although surprising I can get over that.
   * `pipenv sync`: Installs dependencies from the lock file. Seems good, though strange to have a separate command.
   * `pipenv update`: Looks like it pulls updates to all outdated packages and then runs `pipenv lock`. Sounds good.
   * `pipenv update my_pkg`: Also looks like it updates all outdated packages rather than just my\_pkg and anything that may need updated to make the new version work. Seems either broken or useless as it is the same as a bare `pipenv update`
   * `pipenv install --selective-upgrade my_pkg`: Looks like what I want for above (why is it under `install`?). This logs out that it's found an update to my\_pkg but running my code with `pipenv run python blah.py` it's still importing the old version. Either I'm wrong or this is broken.
   * `pipenv lock`: If I run `pipenv lock`, wait for some update to be published and run `pipenv lock` again, will this lock at the newer package?

Essentially I'd like someone to clarify how to accomplish some of the following workflows:

* install a new dependency without updating the world
* upgrade a locked dependency that updates the package in the venv, updates the lock file and only updates other existing packages if there are conflicts with the new package (or it's dependencies).
* install directly from Pipfile.lock without upgrades to the system. `pipenv install --system --deploy --ignore-pipfile` looks like it does this. I don't understand why `--ignore-pipfile` is part of install when `pipenv sync` is all about the lock file. I'd like `pipenv sync --system --deploy` for building docker images. 
* pre-releases for only one package rather than the entire pipfile, ideally I don't even want \`.devN\` packages sync'd to the lock file while I'm developing/testing a package update locally.

I work on a small team on a fairly complex django/python project which makes purely local development quite difficult because we are accepting inbound API requests as well as other types of messages from 3rd parties,  so having our ""development"" VMs set up in AWS with DNS and firewall exceptions in place is basically necessity.

I've taken to using vim myself because I can just ssh and use django ""runserver"",   bare 'pdb' statements etc. But this is a hard sell for the rest of my team who prefer pycharm , atom/vscode etc.

I've tested using sshfs as well as nfs to mount the remote code folder and use a local GUI IDE,.  It \*sortof\* works, but is extremely slow with git operations (lots of small i/o is exactly what git does and doing this over ssh/nfs is very slow).

"EXOTIC STATS PROBLEM ; MODE, FUZZY CLUSTERS, ETC

Hi I'm working on a math problem and not sure how to approach it.

Trying to enumerate, rank and extract most common numeric ranges

from a list, with a twist ;

Basic operation example is, I have ten numeric values representing

weights in variable unit measure types, i.e. grams, ounces, etc

Each value is unique and is a decimal value, 

for example we have the following set of numbers

shown below.  In this set, we are interested in the

most common magnitudinal range.  Here the most

common range value is shown by three values ;

295.999, 312.015, 330.111

the complete set is shown ;

.........................

102.35

8000.32

330.111

295.999

77.01

16.999

1099.222

645

890.01

312.015

.........................

What I want to be able to do, is to input a list of ten values similar to the above,

and have some way, to simply, easily derive the most common value by range.

If I was using values that were more static, for example if all value in the range

in the list were all similar such as ""310"", then I could just use the mode function

and it would easily tell me this.

However since the values are variable decimal types, I am a bit stumped as to how

I would accomplish this.  I came across Python Fuzzy Clustering and it looks like

this might work possibly in relation to mode but wondering if there is a simpler, easier, faster

way to do this?

The end goal is I want to be able to do pattern analysis on a list of numbers and return

the most common range of highest magnitude.

Outputs desired, as an example from the list above would be the thee values printed

to screen, text file, or variable

???? better way to do this than ; 

1.) Fuzzy Clustering

2.) Mode (most common value) of discrete data.","EXOTIC STATS PROBLEM ; MODE, FUZZY CLUSTERS, ETC",93hzwd,new

"Hey all,

As a thorough geek I'm always working to advance my skills whether I'm looking for new jobs or not, and for ages I've been seeing a lot of job descriptions using the ever-popular buzzwords ""scalable"", ""high-availability"", ""fault tolerant"" and the like.

I'm curious, is there anything that someone as an individual developer not really working on large, scalable systems can do to demonstrate knowledge in this realm? I mean, I've got lots of GitHub repos up demonstrating my python chops with Django, building REST APIs, tying them to various front end tools like React and Redux, test drive development, stuff like that, but I feel like I have nothing to demonstrate that I know how to use AWS, Google Cloud, Hadoop, big data analytics tools, etc except for a couple projects I've done for dev shops which had an NDA so I can't share the code. Are there projects out there that an individual could do to demonstrate knowledge in this area? 

If it's ok, I'd love to have an open discussion about this. Anyone working on large systems where scalability is a key concept would be very welcome to provide any feedback! I'm thinking things like, how do I demonstrate that I can build an app that can handle millions of users, complex, rapid fire DB queries, can deliver 5 9s uptime, etc, without actually building a huge app/site like this myself? I don't have anything personally that I'm working on that would require this so I'm finding it difficult to conceptualize something that would demonstrate it, but I really want to keep learning cause I'm getting bored with my current skillset!

"Hi all,

I have automate and do some complex computation while using Excel as the
visualization layer. I have to use Excel, as the visualization layer, because
the customers of this app will need to change and do some computations,
plotting etc which they are already very familiar with, but maybe something I
can't provide to them. We have tried doing this using webapps, but it turned
out to be too slow and the types of analysis that my customers need too varied
for me to provide it to them through a web-interface, which has to be specially
programmed.

Currently, the excel template that we have stores the actual numerical and
textual data in excel itself. For binary data, we use a network filesystem. Somebody coded the template in `VBA` and while they did a great job, I think it will be a bit of a pain, because VBA and its editor doesn't easily allow for `unit-testing`, `refactoring` or access to a huge number of libraries that `python` already provides by default. 

My current goal, is to keep the `VBA` plugin as is, and based on the requested
features from my customers, I want to start implement them in `python` using
the COM functionality. In the very long term, I want to move towards a
server-client system where the data is stored on a server, the analysis is done
on a server, and Excel serves as the interface for obtaining the data and doing
any adhoc analysis.

I am aware of `comtypes`, `win32com` to control `Excel` using Python, but I
have also seen `IronPython`(based on .NET), and `ExcelDNA`. 

I have searched quite a bit.. but I haven't yet been able to find a good discussion.

them?

I've looked around and haven't been able to find an answer. Is there a reason one shouldn't use a SQL (or possibly NoSQL) database to not only store training data, but also results from training or even hyper-parameters and metadata?

Usually I just save everything using CSV or pickle files in hierarchies of directories based around different hyper-parameters, training sessions, etc, which works for the most part.

I was also trying to figure out a good way of setting up the schema, but everything I've come up with seems like I'm working against good practices or optimization. Storing the training data would be straightforward, but things like the results of each training session don't seem suitable for SQL databases. 

For example: if the data is a time series and you want to track a ""reward"" or something similar at each time step (along with any other time-based data), would you set up a table for each value where each row is a different training session and each column is the datetime of a the time step?

The idea is that during prototyping you often realize that you need one additional program argument/option and instead of going to the task of writing an argument parser and than pass the argument through your program until it reaches the desired function, you can use configfy to overwrite a keyword argument of the function with an config file.
I hope someone will find this useful or interesting; or completely ridiculous, under any circumstances I would be happy to hear your comments and ideas.

I've been installing packages with --user but lately things have been hectic and a lot of stuff crashed. I don't want any virtualenv or anything else. I just want to use it as if I'm on Windows!,Is there anyway to move pip to PATH in Ubuntu?,92vbrs,new
