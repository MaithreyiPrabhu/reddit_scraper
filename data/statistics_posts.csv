"This is a rant.

For a little background on this rant, I have two academic biostatisticians in my immediate family, including one who recently retired. I am an academic epidemiologist who functions as an applied statistician in much of my work.

The most common complaint I hear from biostatisticians about their jobs is that their time is grossly under-appreciated. One of the statisticians in my family has related countless stories to me of being put grants to do data analysis at 2-5% funding. For non-academics, this is like someone paying for an hour or two of your time. In my experience, this is enough to attend a weekly or biweekly meeting and answer occasional high-level questions about stats. It is not nearly enough to do data analysis. 

This reflects a larger pattern that statisticians are viewed as essentially the backbone of an academic service sector. 

That's what this sub is. I can't recall the last time I saw a post from /r/statistics show up in my feed that was remotely interesting. It's almost exclusively people with little to no statistical training essentially getting free statistics consulting. While I find it fun to help people, I no longer see the value in using my hard fought knowledge to support other people's work on this subreddit. Many of us could be making good money for the type of advice we hand out here, but instead we are left answering homework questions or helping out researchers who should be paying for another statistician's time.

I can't, in good conscience, keep providing for free what others should be getting paid for.

I wish I had a solution for this sub other than just quitting it. /r/machinelearning recently had a post that was very similar to this one, and the sub went through major changes. Now, there is a lot of interesting content about current research that gets posted there, and the incessant string of ""how does backpropogation work?""-type questions came to a swift end. I don't have time or energy to moderate that kind of sub, but I'm worried that my views represent the views of a lot of subscribers to this sub who no longer see the worth of it. Some ideas would be: weekly discussion of items from Andrew Gelman's blog; journal clubs; debates; AMAs; anything but homework problems.

I wish I had more solutions, but I've at least decided to stop being part of the problem by boycotting the overwhelming onslaught of posts that ask absurdly basic questions. If you are an academic and you need someone to help you with an analysis: include some money in a grant to keep a statistician employed. If you are a student, ask your TA. If you are just curious, start by asking Google.","This sub is a microcosm of the field of statistics, which isn't a good thing",85xp2c,top,102,209,209,0

>I had the most satisfying Eureka experience of my career while attempting to teach flight instructors that praise is more effective than punishment for promoting skill-learning. When I had finished my enthusiastic speech, one of the most seasoned instructors in the audience raised his hand and made his own short speech, which began by conceding that positive reinforcement might be good for the birds, but went on to deny that it was optimal for flight cadets. He said, “On many occasions I have praised flight cadets for clean execution of some aerobatic maneuver, and in general when they try it again, they do worse. On the other hand, I have often screamed at cadets for bad execution, and in general they do better the next time. So please don't tell us that reinforcement works and punishment does not, because the opposite is the case.” This was a joyous moment, in which I understood an important truth about the world: because we tend to reward others when they do well and punish them when they do badly, and because there is regression to the mean, it is part of the human condition that we are statistically punished for rewarding others and rewarded for punishing them. I immediately arranged a demonstration in which each participant tossed two coins at a target behind his back, without any feedback. We measured the distances from the target and could see that those who had done best the first time had mostly deteriorated on their second try, and vice versa. But I knew that this demonstration would not undo the effects of lifelong exposure to a perverse contingency.

I worked my way through the whole series as a supplement to my own University's theoretical stats course, and I made extensive handwritten notes with some extra exposition in places where I had trouble understanding what the prof was saying. It occurred to me that other people might find these useful if I were to transcribe them into LaTeX -- maybe not everyone has the time to go through 24+ hours of video footage.

"Here's the [old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/8pju48/how_can_i_learn_the_linear_algebra_matrix/e0bw73x/). 

Here are my updated recommendations. **You only need to read one book per bolded section below.**

**Introductory Linear Algebra** (i.e., starting from square one - you should cover **everything** in these books):

- [*Linear Algebra and Its Applications*](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Its-Applications-5th/dp/032198238X) by Lay

- [*Introduction to Linear Algebra*](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Linear-Algebra-Gilbert-Strang/dp/0980232775/) by Strang

**Linear Algebra, with a focus on what you need for statistics** (pursue **after** you have mastered the introductory linear algebra):

- [*Linear Algebra Done Wrong*](https://www.math.brown.edu/~treil/papers/LADW/LADW.html), Treil. I would recommend focusing on all of Ch. 1, all of Ch. 2 (skip 2.8), Ch. 3.1 through 3.5, all of Ch. 4, Ch. 5.1 through 5.4 (5.4 is *extremely* important). The only disadvantage of this book is that it isn't specifically geared toward statistics.

- [*Matrix Algebra*](http://www.amazon.com/Matrix-Algebra-Computations-Applications-Statistics/dp/0387708723) by Gentle. Does *not* cover proofs, but it is a nice catalog of methods and ideas you should know for a stats program. Chapters 1 through 3 are essential material. Depending on the math prerequisites demanded, chapter 4 is nice to know. I would also recommend 5.8, 5.9, 6.7, 6.8, and 7.7. Chapters 8.2 - 8.5 are essential material, along with 9.1 - 9.2. This includes the linear model material as well that you will find in a M.S. program. All of the other stuff is optional or minimally covered in a stats program, as far as I know. There has since been an [updated second edition released](https://www.amazon.com/Matrix-Algebra-Computations-Applications-Statistics/dp/3319648667/).

For good reference material (I wouldn't recommend trying to learn from this unless you have *a lot* of time, but it's been extremely useful as a reference):

- [*Matrix Algebra From a Statistician's Perspective*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/038794978X/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_2?pf_rd_p=1944687602&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=0387708723&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=08XWF6K2CZT7PYNEMFKW) by Harville. This does not cover any of the linear model material itself, but rather the matrix algebra behind it. It is the most complete book I have found so far on linear algebra for statistics. For the most part, you should know Chapters 1 through 14, 16-18, 20, and 21.  

I haven't read [Searle's text](https://www.amazon.com/Matrix-Algebra-Useful-Statistics-Probability/dp/1118935144) yet, but I've heard good things about the first edition.

**For linear models** (pursue **after** you have mastered the introductory linear algebra. You don't necessarily need to have read the statistics-focused linear algebra texts before pursuing these linear models texts, but the stats-focused linear algebra texts are nice to have as a reference):

- [*Plane Answers to Complex Questions*](https://www.amazon.com/Plane-Answers-Complex-Questions-Statistics/dp/1441998152/) by Christensen. START ON THE APPENDICES FIRST, and THEN proceed to chapter 1.

- [*Foundations of Linear and Generalized Linear Models*](https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Linear-Generalized-Probability-Statistics/dp/1118730038/) by Agresti

- [*A Primer on Linear Models*](https://www.amazon.com/Primer-Linear-Chapman-Statistical-Science/dp/1420062018/) by Monahan

"So my stats professor just told my upper-level stats class that the use of R-squared values is one of the biggest mistakes made in statistics today.  Here are some of his reasons for while we shouldn't use it.  

1.) It does not measure goodness of fit because it can be arbitrarily low even when the model is correct, and close to 1 even when the model is wrong.

2.) It is also a pretty useless measure of predictability because it says nothing about prediction error and nothing about interval forecasts.

3.) It cannot be compared across datasets.

4.) It cannot be compared across untransformed and transformed models.

He has a few more reasons but they are in our notes and pretty long.  I'm just been taught my entire life about R-squared and now he seems to be going in the complete opposite direction.  I may be misinterpreting what he's saying about it, but I'm just curious if what he is saying is true?  If you need more details on his reasoning I can show you the source where it comes from.

EDIT: Here are the notes containing his arguments.  It starts on page 17.

"After playing Snakes 'n Ladders with my kids I became curious about the number of turns it could take to complete in the best and worst case scenarios. I posted here just in case anyone else is curious.

I wrote a python script to play the game as a single player and count how many turns it took to complete. I had it play 10 million times (which took 36 minutes, btw) and recorded the data for a [histogram](https://imgur.com/VCdi0Hx) as well as the results below.

    completed game 10000000 times
    max turns: 862
    min turns: 7
    average turns: 59.3
    median turns: 46

One curious result I noticed was that there were zero occurrences for both 129 and 251 turns. ~~Perhaps it just works out that these are impossible to attain with the particular snake/ladder configuration.~~ [Detail here](https://imgur.com/5KKtq1V)

perhaps someone can find a bug that caused my 'gaps'.
The rules I used were: No extra turns on a 6 roll. No bounce-back at 100, need exactly 100 to win, otherwise the turn is skipped.

EDIT 2:
It looks like my gap issue was just due to how I plotted my histogram. I set my number of bins to the max number of turns. But, many turn quantities were skipped, causing them to get out of sync with the bins. And, or most importantly, my first value is 7, not 0/1, so that probably plays a part.

"This past weekend I was helping a friend at a local startup accelerator. He was really frustrated - after making a few adjustments based on the data he collected - his profits seemed to have gone **DOWN** - *instead of up.*

&nbsp;

Since he ""followed the data"", he was convinced that he made the right decision. He asked me to help him figure out what went wrong. 

&nbsp;

Turns out... his data was literally ""lying"" to him. This wasn't a case of ""garbage in = garbage out"", but one of those rare/tricky incidents where *your data can actually trick you into making the **OPPOSITE** decision*.

&nbsp;

I decided to write a post explaining (and an [Animated Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj2QV7cfUfQ)) how this happens so you guys don't get fooled down the line. I use the **UCBerkeley Sex Discrimination Law Suit** example, and a **business case example** to illustrate. 


&nbsp;

Take the time to read through this - it may pay off sometime down the line. For those of you who want to watch an illustration (easier to understand) here's the video: **[YouTube - Simpson's Paradox Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj2QV7cfUfQ)**


&nbsp;


**Simpson’s Paradox - How Data Can Fool You**


------------------------------------

Data - data - data. We’re increasingly becoming a society obsessed with data!i Important decision-making  meetings will often parrot the phrase “Well...What does the data say”.

Being “data-informed” is all well and good. But using it at face value to drive decision making can be rather dangerous. In this post, we will discuss one of the ways data can trick you into making the wrong decision - The Simpson’s Paradox.

In 1973 UC Berkeley was sued for sex-discrimination. It turned  out of all the female students who applied - only 35% of them were admitted.  While  out all the male students who applied 44% of them were admitted. 


&nbsp;

        |  Applicants  |    Admitted | 
---|------|---|
 Men| 8442 | 44% |
Women | 4321 |  35% |



&nbsp;

The data raised a lot of eyebrows. And the witch-hunt was on! UC Berkeley set out to  find the main culprits of this gender discrimination.

To do this they broke open the data to see which departments were mainly responsible for this GENDER BIAS ---  And here is what they found:

&nbsp;

Department | # No. of Men| #No. Of Women| Men Accepted| Women Accepted|
---|------|------|------|------|------|
A | 825 | 108 | 62% |**82%** | 
B | 560 | 25 | 63% |**68%** | 
C | 325 | 593 | 37% |34% | 
D | 417 | 375 | 33% |**35%** | 
E | 191 | 393 | 28% |24% | 
F | 373 | 341 | 6% |**7%** | 
- | Total 8442 | Total: 4321 |  | | 


&nbsp;

Now this is where the data gets funny. After breaking open the data, we see a different story.  Out of the 6 departments 4 of the departments accepted women more than men. There definitely was a gender bias - but it was in favour FOR the women. Not against!
&nbsp;

But that begs the question? Why did the aggregated data tell a different story? 

&nbsp;

This is a classic case of the Simpson’s Paradox -  when grouped-up data tells the opposite story of the ungrouped data.  This happens because of a confounding-factor that is hidden from sight WITHIN the data.

&nbsp;

So what’s this “hidden factor” that’s causing all the mischief? Take a look at firstand the last rows of the table. You’ll notice that Department A has a pretty high acceptance rate - especially for women at 82%!  However, out the 4000+ women only a 108 of them applied to Department B. That’s only 2% of all women who applied across departments.

&nbsp;


On the other hand, 825 of the men applied to Department A! That’s 10% of all the male applicants. You may have already spotted the mischief. But let’s go on.  Take a look at the last row. Again, the women have a higher acceptance rate than the men. But over here - Department F, in contrast to Department A, has a very LOW acceptance rate.

&nbsp;

And this is where it goes wrong. Compared to the men,  a much larger portion of the women applied to this low-acceptance department.  Around 4% of all the men applied here. While 8% of all the women applied to Department F. So in truth, women weren’t being discriminated against. It just so happened that a large proportion of them were applying to a low-acceptance rate department while a large proportion of men were applying to high-acceptance rate department. That skewed the overall results.


&nbsp;

This sort of data mischief - The Simpsons Paradox - can happen everywhere. Even in businesses who use data to make decisions. Here’s a business-case example. A CEO and his team were deliberating whether to use a One-Click advertisement campaign or Two-Click campaign. That’s when the marketing manager - who happened to support the Two-Click campaign showed him some data:


&nbsp;

                 | #Users (mil)  | Rev (mil) | Rev per thousand users |
--------------|-------------|------- |------------|
Single Click|230 Users  |$2.9 |11.60 RPM  |
Double Click  |140 Users  |  $1.7  | 12.14 RPM  |


Single Click had more users allocated to it, and thus more revenue - but the RPM (revenue per thousand users) is higher for double click. When you look at the data - the decision is obvious. Double Click is generating more money per user - so they should go with double click, correct? 

&nbsp;

Turns out, picking the Double-Click campaign would have been a costly mistake. Let’s break open the data again - into its subgroups of International users and Local users:

&nbsp;

                             | #Users (mil)  | Rev (mil) | Rev per thousand users |     User% Per Group
------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------|----------------|
 Single Click-Local     |      50 Users   |       $1.8   |         25.71 RPM   |                        42 %  |
 Double Click-Local      |     70 Users      |   $1.2     |       24.00 RPM        |                   58% |
 Single  Click-Inter         |   180 Users     |   $1.1         |   6.11 RPM         |                   67% |
 Double Click-Inter  |      90  Users   |       $0.5        |   5.56 RPM          |                  33% |


&nbsp;

Suddenly, the data tells a different story. Single click is outperforming Double-Click in both subgroups - Local AND International? How is this possible?

&nbsp;

Simpson’s Paradox at play again. The grouped up data has a hidden factor that tells the opposite story of the ungrouped data. In this case, the hidden factor was that only 33% of international users were shown the double-click page, while only  58% of the local users were shown the double-click page.

&nbsp;

And in general the local users had a much higher RPM than international users. So the local users who had a much higher proportion of double click users and a higher RPM skewed the overall data.

&nbsp;

**Final Thoughts**

This was a tough example. Take a minute to  analyse the data. Simpson’s Paradox can be tricky - the key is to look out for any hidden variables that may be influencing your data!  Don’t rely too much on your data. If something smells fishy - look into it. Do not trust your data blindly.  Use your data to formulate hypothesis and be data-informed, not data driven. Test your hypothesis, if it goes wrong, you know you need to look for something else.

"I posted this in /r/datascience two weeks ago and didn't find much useful advice.  Figured it's worth a shot posting here because this sub has more people with strong statistics backgrounds.  I’ve already decided that I’m changing jobs so please don’t give me a list of reasons to stay.

I've been employed for almost two and a half years.  Graduated undergrad in 2014 and finished a Master's in Statistics from a top West Coast university in 2016.  I was the person my peers would go to for help with statistics questions and sometimes still get hit up by old friends to help them out.  I didn't do a thesis for various university bureaucratic reasons I'd prefer not to get into, and an internship I did between years turned out to have no data analysis component at all.  My undergrad was similar.  I'd take an internship or a research position where I was told I'd be doing interesting data analysis work.  Then once I got there it would turn out that I'd have no mentorship or that actually I'd be doing some other task that requires coding but no statistics, but has some vague data-related component.  Because of this I have very good technical skills in SQL, Python, and R, but not much experience applying them to solve analysis or machine learning problems.

My dilemma is I've had two data scientist positions at medium-sized companies where I've done very little analysis.  The first one was sold to me as an analysis/engineer position, but I did one analysis in the full year and a month I was there and the rest was focused on data quality control.  I was laid off because they claimed to not have any data analysis work available for me.  My current position is awesome except for the actual work.  I've been there for 18 months and I've just done exploratory analysis and dashboarding, with zero statistics.  My current company has cool ML work, but a conversation with my boss indicated that he thinks it's a giant waste of time that doesn't help the business.  He won't let me take on ML work, even though it's one area where I have a ton of interest.  We have no procedure for internal transfers and don't see any way to obtain one without his approval.

I'm at the end of my rope and want to do more meaty and quantitative work than what I'm currently doing, which to be blunt, bores the living shit out of me.  I'm a statistician by trade who has done no statistics in two and a half years years.  However job hunting has been quite difficult.  There don't seem to be many modeling focused positions even when I look for other job titles like ""Applied Scientist"".  I've been heavily targeting particular companies I want to work at and getting referrals, but have been rejected at the resume stage for many junior-level roles where I'd be doing modeling.  I've had my resume looked over by a bunch of people and none of them see anything wrong with it.  Because of my lack of professional statistics experience, my resume focuses on my ability to work with a diverse variety of professionals, gathering requirements, and presenting deliverables in a way that's useful for them.  Essentially all of the soft skills I'd expect to use in a more standard data scientist position.

Based on what I've indicated here, what kinds of positions should I be looking for?  Should I be targeting positions where I'm doing modeling and predictive analytics positions, or is my lack of experience in those areas going to fuck me over?  If I shouldn't be targeting those roles yet, what kind of roles should I be targeting to get there?  I'm currently targeting large companies because I feel like the bureaucracy will allow me to get experience precisely in what I get hired to do, rather than getting sidetracked with things like ""Oh I'm a senior person you do data please do this data task that has no analysis or statistical component.""

Additionally, how can I convince recruiters that I should be hired to do explanatory or predictive modeling work?  I'm in touch with a recruiter at a large tech company who tried to sell me a Data Scientist position that turned out would be all A/B testing and dashboarding, which would be my personal hell as a career.  When I asked him about potentially taking on a meatier role building models he said I should be looking at more basic positions that are similar to the A/B testing one.  I've had back-and-forths on LinkedIn with recruiters for some other positions that are advertised as Data Scientist positions, but when I ask how much of the role involves pipelining and wrangling for tasks other than doing data analysis, I almost always find out that they're doing a bait-and-switch and it's actually a 100% engineering role.

I'm quickly approaching the three year mark where junior careers usually end and feel completely stagnant and like I have nothing to show for it.  I have job security where I am now but if circumstances change, it's going to be far more difficult to continue on an upward career path than it is now.

If it helps I'm in the Greater Seattle Area, living downtown and working in Redmond.  There are some Meetups that look potentially nice but they're all sponsored by boot camps and the last time I went to a talk at one of them, it was basically a pitch for why you should give them money.  I have contacts at many large companies in the area, and those contacts can vouch for my enthusiasm and skill around statistics.",Currently employed as a data scientist but am worried because my statistics skills are deteriorating.

"I’m taking a position in a paid internship when fall semester rolls around. The dude I’ll be working under is an MD PHD who is focused on developing new methods which in his words are “really f***ing simple.” My experience with stats has been the equivalent of the introductory stats course at a college and some work in research which involves biostats (this was a lot more mechanical).

He recommended that I read and understand the elements of statistical learning (textbook which is available free as a pdf.) I have burned through ISLR 7th ed (introduction to statistical learning) but it was a much more focused reading on certain methods for my work. I would love to understand the math behind everything so I can hopefully keep pace at my new internship. 

Alternatively, if anyone has any resources on learning about the math behind statistical learning techniques please let me know!

Thanks for your time!

Edit: Hot dayum this post garnered a lot of attention. I am going to add a couple of things real quickly, I have two time frames to learn this, the first is around a month, the second is until around Christmas break. Because of this I will be blowing through the book for quite a while until my fall semester starts, then I will revisit each chapter at a slower pace.

I would also like to clarify that I might not do all the labs in the coming few weeks, I am targeting lower level comprehension and the ability to look at a formula and know what it does. Of course, I will be doing some side projects later on.

Finally, a few people have pmd me asking if this is on Slack or Discord. I am honestly fine with either, but I have much more experience and an affinity for Discord, especially since we can set up targeted channels for each chapter and a few more for questions, projects, etc. If y’all can let me know your preference through posting or pms I can go ahead and get started tonight itself.

Side note: Some of y’all are grad students, some are just interested in the topic. I myself am still in undergrad and I really only know just enough so that I can publish my manuscripts in medical journals. That translates to a pretty surface level understanding of stats with maybe a slightly deeper focus on some topics. I’d like this to help everyone though. 

Edit 2: This is going to be on Slack, I am gonna pm all the replies here with an invite link. If you are interested but don't want to post here for some reason, pm me and I will send you the link. If I skip you by accident, pm me and I will send you the links

Another reason I look down on it is that I've talked to a lot of black belts about statistics.  Apparently they don't like it when you call Six Sigma the ""McDonalds of statistics"".

"I don't really come from a statistics/data science background, and don't have a lot of formal training outside online classes, but have ended up in a position where I do a ton of data analysis on a daily basis. And goddamn do I wish someone sat me down and explained this to me sooner.

The reality is it is SO EASY to mess something up and end up with data that looks right but isn't. Forgetting to enable the weights in a survey, messing up the filter in a SQL query, using count instead of distinct count in a pivot table, etc.

I've had clients come back to me four months after a project saying they got different results when they ran the data. Fuck if I know, time to spend 5 hours re-running everything. SAVE YOUR WORK.

I once got to the end of 6 weeks worth of data runs and analyses for a client. Went to double check the data in the final report and couldn't reproduce it. I had no idea what I had run and didn't know if I messed up early or was messing up now. Turns out it was earlier and had to re-do everything. SAVE YOUR WORK.

Most of my day to day work is in excel and SPSS. Unfortunately that means a lot of it is in GUIs that can't be reproduced, so I've been slowly integrating more and more R.

"**TL;DR:** new psychology study claims to use ML methods on MTurk sample as antidote to non-replicability of psych studies, but there are questionable analysis choices (such as dropping 15% of the data and discretizing their continuous outcome variable into 10 unordered classes), the result they get is a variable importance ranking of attributes driving predictive model fit, which they overinterpret and don't acknowledge a much more obvious driver of their finding. Read on if you want to hear more and discuss.

---

I learned about the recent paper [""Good Things for Those Who Wait: Predictive Modeling Highlights Importance of Delay Discounting for Income Attainment""](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01545/full) from the Marginal Revolution blog's Friday link round-up. It's an easy open-access read and I encourage you all to give it a skim. I have a lot of concerns about the methodology and interpretation in this paper and want to discuss this here. (Yes, it's a day ending in 'y', so of course there is a questionable social science study out in a high-impact journal which has garnered [a fair amount of media coverage](http://loop-impact.frontiersin.org/impact/article/359023#socialbuzz) and [over 13K views.](http://loop-impact.frontiersin.org/impact/article/359023#totalviews/views))

The authors tout their machine learning approach to data analysis as superior to traditional methods one might use instead. They motivate their work with concerns about multicollinearity that we experience with ""standard correlational and regression analytic approaches"". While that's fair, I am worried that psychology researchers may take away bad advice from this study when making good-faith efforts to address their field's very well-known issues around replication, which the authors specifically mention as motivating their approach to data collection and analysis.

This also provides an anecdote supporting a trend I've noticed: because of ML hype, there are an increasing number of data analysts who have learned about topics like cross-validation and random forests without having adequate statistical training to ground them. The authors write things like, ""we were able to model continuous, categorical, and dichotomous variables simultaneously, and subsequently compare their relative importance for predicting income; this would not have been possible using more traditional methods."" I don't know what strawman they have in mind, but there's nothing groundbreaking about modeling continuous and categorical features simultaneously. Additionally, I see lots of ""garden of forking paths"" analysis choices that would hinder replication, as many decisions are made on the whole data before the training/test splits, which makes the whole holdout/CV aspect of the paper seem like a lot of show for nothing.

The topic is ""a simple yet essential question: why do some individuals make more money than others?"" They cite prior work around some sociodemographic factors as well as height and the infamous Marshmallow Test around delay discounting (which I should note [has not held up well](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/marshmallow-test/561779/) in recent replications, which they do not cite). It's not totally clear what the authors' scientific questions or hypotheses are, but they seem to think it is interesting to figure out which of the basic sociodemographic and discount delay behavioral attributes they survey MTurkers about are most predictive of income and rank them.

Here's the setup:

* **Data collection:** the study's data come from an Amazon MTurk sample of 3000 Americans aged 25-65 who answered some questions about delayed gratification indifference points. Like: would you rather have $500 now or $1000 in 6 months? If you said $500 now, then would you rather have $250 now or $1000 in 6 months? If you said $1000 in 6 months, then would you rather have $375 now or $1000 in 6 months? etc. splitting the boundaries iterating until you have no preference. The indifference tasks were answered for time frames of 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year (variables of primary interest). The MTurkers also answered questions about income (the dependent outcome of interest), age, sex, race, ethnicity, height, education level, zip code, and occupational group.

* **Data cleaning:** the authors perform aggressive ""outlier"" handling that removes 15% of their data, resulting in n=2564 respondents for analysis. They drop all students and any participant who completed the delay discounting questions in under 2 SDs below the mean task time. The fast-completion removal rule is a red flag because subjects who chose the ""$1000 in the future"" option at the outset would have finished the task much faster than others, and so *the dropped outliers procedure is likely strongly associated with the delay discounting responses* and would bias the data. The authors also say they applied ""extreme value detection and distribution-based inspections"" to other continuous covariates without clarifying further. To me, these look like forking path decisions that may substantially affect the results, and all of this is done before holding out data.

* **Outcome discretization:** This part is the biggest eyebrow raiser: they take the continuous self-reported income outcome variable (ranges from $10K to $235K) and discretize it into 10 buckets containing the same number of (non-outlier) subjects. This converts their analysis into a 10-level classification task with performance measured by AUC. In discretizing, these income groups become *unordered* labels and thus the authors get much less information out of their data than if they handled this as a regression problem by leaving income as a numeric variable. They claim: ""This conversion also yielded a more compact representation, and thus, less complexity"", to which I say *absolutely NOT.* The loss functions for their ML models treat mis-classifying someone who actually makes $23K a year in the $24.5K-$35.2K group equally as erroneously as mis-classifying them in the $158.4K-$235K group! This transformation is not only statistically wasteful, it leaves their models uninterpretable as a side effect: they can't describe the direction of the relationship between discounting and income or speak to model fit in an understandable way (like RMSE). It's likely that their predictive models would not be robust to different choices for number of outcome levels or cut points.

* **Model fitting:** They messed with income because they are motivated by trying to cram the data into a particular ML framework without being aware of the trade-offs. The authors justify this with: ""Some of the criteria that we used in our feature selection method are more compatible with categorical features. Further, reported incomes were not evenly distributed."" This is the method driving the transformation at the expense of the science and they do not say *why* unevenly distributed incomes would be an issue (hint: they aren't). They run SVMs, neural networks, and random forests on a 90% subset of the data with 10-fold CV, and as part of this process, they calculate feature importance by removing variables one-by-one to rank their contribution in predicting the income labels.

* **Results:** The primary output is [a ranking of which variables they considered in terms of feature importance,](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/359023/fpsyg-09-01545-HTML/image_m/fpsyg-09-01545-t002.jpg) and the underwhelming conclusion: ""Interestingly, delay discounting was more predictive than age, race, ethnicity, and height"" (but that's just 1 year delay discounting, and occupation, education, zip code, and gender are more important). Instead of reporting effect sizes or showing a marginal GAM plot, they have just moved the target to something more stable (importance ranks) but less interesting. To me, this isn't a solution to multicollinearity or non-linearity, it's just replacing a thing we care about with something much less useful. They can't even speak to *how* delayed discounting predicts income to assess whether the models even make scientific sense. For all we know from these results, preferring $1000 in the future over $X now could be *negatively* associated with income after accounting for other attributes.

* **Causality:** They make a brief disclaimer that results are associational and not causal, but they don't mention what seems to me like a simple and obvious explanation for their finding that delayed discounting helps predict income, which is that *income causes delayed discounting* rather than *delayed discounting causes income.* The authors write: ""we speculate that this relationship [aside: whose sign they haven't established!] may be a consequence of the correlation between higher discounting and other undesirable life choices. ... In this way, one possibility is that delay discounting signals a cascade of negative behaviors that derail individuals from pursuing education and may ultimately preclude entry into certain lucrative occupational niches."" I'm no psychologist, but it seems really obvious that someone who makes $20K probably *is* more likely to prefer an immediate windfall of $500 compared to someone who makes $150K who can afford to wait a year to see the full $1000...because they're poor and $500 now may go far in paying for today's expenses.",you can't fix bad psych methods with bad ML methods: comments on a recent paper,9egem6,top,19,76,76,0

"This is just a personal rant of one frustrated student. I don't want to  troll. I don't want to offend. I just want to vent and hopefully receive some replies and answers that will make a more optimistic about studying statistics. 

We have models, like Bass diffusion, which depend on parameters which are harder to quantify than the problem they're supposed to solve; we have numbers given to us from high (Google's suggestion that 5-10 folds is good enough for k-fold cross-validation). And of course p=0.05 as a defacto standard of important enough.

Our tools just feel broken. Matlab results wildly vary depending on whose machine and what phase of the moon. I have never encountered a programming language as counterintuitive as R. Excel can't figure out whether it wants to do math in binary or decimal. All of them built on top of probably-insufficient RNGs. 

There are enough model-selections to make me wish for a model-selection-selection method. 

Then there's the practice. How are there so many models in the wild that are such textbook examples of overfitting that anyone with an Intro course should be able to spot them? What percentage of medical studies can't be reproduced? And it feels many people have abandoned any attempt for causal explanation because fuck it, understanding is hard and processing power is cheap.

"As a long-time user (and lecturer) of R, I am wondering why Python seems to be so widely used in statistics.

I love Python, it's a great language. Use it all the time. But I just researched how to run a logistic regression (to do something that's a bit more difficult than just OLS) in Python and it was surprisingly complicated. In R, it could hardly be easier: Just use multinom from nnet and you can immediately use all the standard idioms that one knows from so many other kinds of models.

I then tried to look up arguments in favor of using Python when it comes to statistics, but they were surprisingly superficial. For example, it was often said that Python allows doing *more* than stats in one script. While true, is that really *better*?

Why is Python so widely used? It seems like R in conjunction with dplyr and other useful packages is vastly superior when it comes to stats. (Even though I love Python in general.)",Python vs. R,8v4zp4,top,87,70,70,0

"So one of friends who's a fellow math major got me a math joke book for Christmas, and he was encouraging me to tell one of the Stats-related jokes during class. I was ready to tell the following joke from the book, which most of you have probably heard already:


*A statistic professor plans to travel to a conference by plane. When he passes the security check, they discover a bomb in his carry-on-baggage. Of course, he is hauled off immediately for interrogation.*

*""I don't understand it!"" the interrogating officer exclaims. ""You're an accomplished professional, a caring family man, a pillar of your parish - and now you want to destroy that all by blowing up an airplane!""*

*""Sorry"", the professor interrupts him. ""I had never intended to blow up the plane.""*

*""So, for what reason else did you try to bring a bomb on board?!""*

*""Let me explain. Statistics shows that the probability of a bomb being on an airplane is 1/1000. That's quite high if you think about it - so high that I wouldn't have any peace of mind on a flight.""*

*""And what does this have to do with you bringing a bomb on board of a plane?""*

*""You see, since the probability of one bomb being on my plane is 1/1000, the chance that there are two bombs is 1/1000000. If I already bring one, the chance of another bomb being around is actually 1/1000000, and I am much safer...""*

"Basically, I'll have some time this summer during my PhD program (I'm a first year student not yet doing any research). One option suggested to me was as a project, take an academic paper and slowly work through it, and understand it thoroughly. I was looking for suggestions for any papers that people think might be suitable. I'm looking for a paper that I would benefit substantially by working through slowly, so likely the method of getting the result is somehow significant (and not some niche trick that isn't used anywhere else). I'm also looking for something that is at a graduate student level (most papers tend to satisfy this), while not requiring too vast an amount of background material (although I fully expect to have to spend some time to get the right background, in fact that's basically the point!)

Any thoughts or suggestions? What papers do you think it's particularly important for PhD students to understand on a deep level, rather than just reading the result and moving on?

"As a requirement for my Psyc program I took a Data Analysis/Statistics course and now I find myself disturbed that I'm fantasizing about data sets while hanging out with friends.

The idea of being able to do this as a job is really exciting, I would want nothing more than to sit there with data and work through them all day. This experience has also been really strange to me, because I've never been strong or interested in math prior to this course.

I'm trying to figure out if there's a future in this for me and how to obtain it, and I'm getting a lot of weird answers when I look online so I'm hoping someone here can help me.

One concern of mine is the focus on mathematics and programming when going into any kind of data profession. I love my Data Analysis course but I don't know if that love is transferable to the pure math and programming courses required for Statistics, and how similar/relevant the course content is.

A second concern is that none of my Psyc courses are transferable to a Stats/CS/Math Major and vice versa, and I'm paying for school out of pocket so time/money is incredibly valuable. I'd like to avoid spending $1000+ and 4+ months on experimenting if I can make an educated decision about it instead.

Lastly and most importantly, **I don't know what career path is best for what I'm interested in**. I see job titles like Statistician, Data Scientist, Actuarial Analyst, Data Analyst, and even after reading about it all I still feel like I don't quite understand where I might fit in, if anywhere at all.

I also occassionally see people with Data Analyst jobs who have MAs in other fields. Should I continue to pursue Psychology with heavy Data courses and finish my MA, and if so, will there be careers for me in Data Analysis? If not, **could anyone provide a professional opinion on which career path resembles most to the work I do in my Data/Statistics class (ie. standard deviation, probability, z-scores, percentiles, etc.)?** And if possible, the most time/cost-effective way of pursuing it? If it helps, I have a 4.33 GPA in my classes including my current standing in my Data/Stats course.

"People attempt to draw conclusions from confidence intervals all of the time such as ""my confidence is small => my point estimate is precise"" and ""I have a 95% confidence interval => Pr( parameter \in CI) = 95%"".  So the reason these two statements are inaccurate is because CIs are really a frequentest a priori kind of argument, where the statements above are attempting to apply a Bayesian understanding to the world.

This phenomenon is really nicely described at length [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-015-0947-8).  The author even goes as far to say ""[So...] how does one then interpret the interval? The answer is quite straightforward: one does not"". So I read this paper and felt very intrigued by the idea, and definitely have bought it in full.  Yet it seems absurd to me that so many statisticians and laymen (this interpretation actually appears in some textbooks, see the above paper) would still use this interpretation if the theory behind it suggests pointedly that it's wrong.

So I ended up asking my econometrics professor about why we learn confidence intervals when they seem strictly inferior to Bayesian approaches to draw conclusions about data, and he told me that it has something to do with the Bernstein-Von Mises, and that the two are roughly the same thing.  

I don't really understand the theorem or the line of reasoning that he derived from it, so hence I came here to see if people can explain the topic in a simple to understand manner like the viewpoint presented in the paper linked above.

During the past few months we have seen an increase in spam-bots posting links to articles not particularly related to statistics and users abusing self-promotion by posting links to their blogs several times a day without generating much discussion. 

We have decided to only allow self posts for the next 30 days to see if it will cool down this behavior. This was a tough decision to make as we don't want to limit the good content that happens through link posts. 

We want to encourage content creators to continue to post their content but it should be posted with a transparent description of what the article is and through the purpose of generating insightful discussion on the forum. 

Self Posts should contain a small description of the article and a reason for discussion. **Posts that contain only a link will be deleted**

We hope this effort can curb the amount of spam you all have been reporting and please continue to be diligent in reporting posts that violate the rules and downvote posts that violate **Rule 2**

* Thoroughly document all the important ""home made"" R functions that are used in my workflow

* Give an overview of the most relevant R libraries that are used in my workflow

* Write a document detailing the results from the project so far and feasible paths forward. Include some domain knowledge/intuitions about the data that is generated in our lab. The domain knowledge I'm unsure about because we have a large volume of material that is not yet analyzed, so my ""sample size"" so to say is not that large.

* Create a library with some statistical theory that might be unfamiliar to the new person 

* Be available through e-mail and possibly skype, and also offer some external assistance with the work itself in the ""transitionary"" period.

>Sports performance is a difficult thing to study. There are only so many trained athletes available for experiments, and most of the measurements required to investigate human performance are time-consuming to collect. As a result, most sports science studies are small, and that means it can be difficult to tease out the signal from the noise. In 2006, Will Hopkins and Alan Batterham published a commentary proposing a method for making meaningful inferences in such situations.

>Their method, “magnitude-based inference,” or MBI, was controversial from the start. It was rebutted in 2008 by two statisticians who concluded that it was generally unreliable and represented an improper use of existing statistical methods. In 2009, the flagship journal of the American College of Sports Medicine, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, published a set of statistical guidelines for the journal that included a description of MBI, but the journal published it as an invited commentary after peer reviewers would not agree to accept it. Since then, MSSE has published two critiques of MBI that concluded the method was too flawed to be used (the most recent of which arose from reporting by FiveThirtyEight). Now FiveThirtyEight has learned that MSSE has decided to stop accepting papers that use MBI.

"So this is a cry for help because I'm a dumb-dumb trying to do grown-up math. I'm a physician assistant in a doctoral program with a cockamamie idea and no background in statistics whatsoever.

What I am trying to accomplish is this - I'm trying to run a Monte Carlo simulation creating subjects on a medical intervention. I'm using 3 independent variables with sample sizes and ranges that I've obtained from medical literature. I've either obtained or calculated means, standard deviation (from reported medians & ranges - method per Hozo et al. 'Estimating the mean and variance from the median, range, and the size of a sample'. BMC Medical Research Methodology. 5:13. April 2005). The independent variables are continuous data. I was thinking of pooling them from the literature and obtain sort of a ""meta-distribution"" so I can determine if it's normally distributed or not. I have a strong feeling that they are not normally distributed from cursory reading. From these variables, I want to run a simulation for my dependent variable - survival to discharge (dichotomous - yes/no). Survival to discharge is generally about 40 to 60&#37; in the literature. There are no known mathematically defined relationships between the independent variables and dependent variables.

Evidently I don't know what I'm doing, but I have this deep visceral feeling that I'm doing something outrageously wrong. Your expert opinion is requested. My questions are as follows:

1) Is it legitimate to calculate mean, variance (and subsequently standard deviation) from the method that I found?

2) Does it make sense to ""pool"" the data from many studies to create the range & distribution for a Monte Carlo simulation? Assuming my independent variables are a, b, and c  AND that some studies report some of the variables and not all, is it still fair to pool the data where available?

3) The studies are inconsistent on whether or not they report individual data, even though their sample sizes tend to be small (n<20). Am I able to determine the distribution based off mean, standard deviation alone? 

4) If I can accomplish questions 1-3 without raising most eyebrows, how do I perform a Monte Carlo simulation with multiple independent variables with non-normal distribution, a dichotomous dependent variable?",Idiot Doing Monte Carlo Simulation,8rvqcm,top,16,48,48,0
"I'm familiar with *how* Monte Carlo works; I've been using it for two years in my position at an insurance company. But what I'm unsure of is how the scientific community became convinced that it works and produces useful results. I tried doing my own research but I can't find any arguments for *why* it works, just how it works and how to do it. 

Our relatively elementary model we use at work takes a matrix of 10,000 economic scenarios (with Treasury curves, credit spreads, equity returns, and other variables for each scenario) generated by a vendor solution, calculates the financial impact of each scenario on the company, and spits out a 1x10,000 distribution of those financial impacts. This distribution is always pretty close to a normal distribution, every time we update it with new information. Should we be concerned that it's always such a nicely behaved normal distribution? Did we unintentionally cook it up to behave like this? Is this a feature of Monte Carlo? Do MC models ever not ""converge"" like this? My exposure to the technique is limited to this model so I have nothing to compare it to.

"There are quite a bit of online data repositories (many listed on the sidebar) that contain interesting real data. I was hoping that maybe we could choose a data set each month (week?) and collectively analyze it.

The analyses may include:

1. Defining simple hypotheses and testing them.

2. Estimating various parameters.

3. Carrying out diagnostic procedures to test our model assumptions.

4. Some cool ways of visualizing the data.

I feel that this would be beneficial for statisticians regardless of skill level. If you are an expert then this may help you practice what you know and flex your statistical muscle. Beginners can also learn how the process works and pick up on tips and 'tricks' of the trade.

If this is successful then maybe we can have our own repository of methods and how to use them. Maybe start with data sets that address commonly asked questions. For example, how to compare means, contingency tables, simple ANOVA and regression, etc. Also, participants may want to provide their code so others can use it and build upon it.

I would love to get your feedback on this. Comments, suggestions, criticisms and volunteers are all welcome. Thanks.

Edit: Nice to see there's some interest in this. The next step: I have been browsing some data sets from public repositories. I will pick one and get the ball rolling by providing code for data input and basic statistical functions. Perhaps suggest some hypotheses to investigate.

**If you have a data set in mind please PM me.**

Edit2: So glad that many of you like the idea. So to start off I will pick a simple enough data set with some interesting properties that we can exploit for the first exercise.

Also, just to start things off, I will suggest some hypothesis and do a step by step on how to test it. Then we see where it goes from there.

However, today I accidentally covered a statistics course that partially met my criteria. It's the [Introduction to Statistics](https://02402.compute.dtu.dk/home) course from the Technical University of Denmark. What I like about this course is:

1) The textbook is free!

2) Video lectures are available (under the 'Podcast' tab of the course website)

3) Homework and solutions are available, as well as exams going back a few years (again, with solutions!)

4) Most formulas have mathematical derivations (though it might not be quite as rigorous as an standard mathematical statistics course e.g. calculus was not present much, if at all)

5) It combines both probability and statistics so someone who wants to refresh both topics or learn them both for e.g. machine learning could accomplish quickly in one course

6) R programming is used liberally in the book and the homework, which is great for those who want to learn the material through programming

"Forgive me for the rant, but I’m kind of disappointed with all the cheating that is going on in my grad program. It kind of pisses me off that I sit there for hours and struggle with the material, while some other people just copy homework solutions from Chegg or other resources. It’s pretty obvious though and the professor is no fool. He notices that some people average 90-100 on homework, but then get 30s on exams. (Probably why homework is like 10% of our grade and exams are like 30% each). The low scores could be due to many factors: time constraints, bad day, different types of questions, bad teaching methods, etc…More likely than not, it’s because the person didn’t understand the material or was cheating. Last exam there was a 23 point curve, so the grades were pretty low. 

&nbsp;

Another thing I have issues with: for most classes we have to give a 15-20 minute talk on some topic in the course material, which I think is excellent because it helps students become more comfortable with presenting things to an audience, which is a great skill to have, especially in industry. But anyways, some of the presentations were either too short, or just unclear. Some people just copied things off the internet without understanding and just read off the slides. When the professor questioned them and asked them to clarify something, they just froze, didn’t respond, and just continued reading the slides. It was supposed to be a learning experience for the class, but I doubt anyone learned something from the presentations. There were a couple interesting presentations though.

&nbsp;

Let me just clarify that around half of my class of 23 students are Asian international students (mostly Chinese or Korean, but a couple of Indians as well). Some of them are cool and very intelligent, others, I’m not sure why they’re there. It could be a language barrier, but their English is ok, so I’m not sure. Maybe cheating is normal in their home country, idk. Maybe they’re just seeking the credential of the M.S. degree and are just doing it because it pays well, and cheating is the quickest solution that requires the least effort. Idk. Too many factors to consider. I leave it as an exercise for social science researchers to perform this experiment and test the hypotheses. 

&nbsp;

Oh well, at least I'll be more competitive than the cheaters when interviewing for jobs because I can actually talk about what I know/learned. Anyways, that’s my story, if anyone has faced something similar, please feel free to share.

"Methodology   
I spent Sunday, Monday, Tuesday (July 16-18, 2017) at Disneyland. Beginning with my check-in to the Disneyland Hotel at 6pm on July 16 until midnight July 19 I counted every instance of pro sports apparel I saw. During this time, I was (mostly) actively searching the crowd for instances. This includes the Disneyland Hotel, Downtown Disney, Disneyland, and Disney California Adventure. If one person had multiple instances of memorabilia (hat and shirt for example) I only counted that once. If I saw the same person within a short timeframe, I only counted that person once, but it's possible a person got counted multiple times after an hour or so. Generally, I remembered the numbers in my head for about an hour or so, then jotted the totals down on my cell phone workpad. Mistakes are possible, but I have a pretty good memory, so the final numbers are pretty robust. I did not count any college sports, even USC which some would argue qualifies as a pro sports team.

"I'm trained as a psychologist with far more stats classes and experience than is healthy for psychologists--though it still doesn't make me a statistician by a long shot (it might make me some kind of ""data scientist"" though...). I've been a faculty member for several years, and have done a couple dozen consulting gigs, mostly unpaid work with colleagues to analyze data for publication or for a dissertation. Once or twice I've been paid, in one instance for a multi-year study, analyzing educational outcomes from a program at my university. Despite the scope, however, my involvement was limited to a few months analyzing data collected by others and (in theory) ready and waiting for analysis and reports.

Now a large (relative to local sizes and relative to my experiences) social services agency wants to pay me, from an HHS program grant they received, for a few years running to analyze the (excellent, BTW) data they collect from their clients to determine what impact their services are having. I need to use this opportunity to get a few publications, too (at least some of the analysis is in my general realm of expertise), or else this opportunity could hurt me, career-wise--a lot--instead of helping. But if I get pubs, then it helps--a lot.

In a few weeks I'll meet to sign a contract for the work. I am realizing I have no idea what I'm getting myself into.

**Experienced data analysts/consultants:**

*  How do I build in guarantees that this won't begin to suck important time away from my academic job?
*  What details should I know, learn, specify, etc. before signing a contract?
*  What other ""gotchas"" do I need to look for?
*  I make not-much-money at a not-big-school. What financial consequences should I be preparing for, in getting paid a significant fraction of my current salary?
*  What legal ramifications should I be worried about? What about possible legal headaches? Ways to legally prevent the above?


The analysis doesn't worry me; it's not beyond my abilities, so far. The business part worries me, as noted above. And the ""not screwing up important community relationships"" part. And the Unknown Unknowns--those worry me the most.

- The combination of methods was the king of the M4. Of the 17 most accurate methods, 12 were “combinations” of mostly statistical approaches.

- The biggest surprise was a “hybrid” approach that utilised both statistical and ML features. This method produced both the most accurate forecasts and the most precise PIs, and was submitted by Slawek Smyl, a Data Scientist at Uber Technologies. According to sMAPE, it was close to 10% more accurate than the combination benchmark.

- The second most accurate method was a combination of seven statistical methods and an ML one, with the weights for the averaging calculated by an ML algorithm that was trained to minimise the forecasting error through holdout tests. This method was submitted jointly by Spain’s University of A Coruña and Australia’s Monash University.

- The most accurate and second most accurate methods also achieved an amazing success in specifying the 95% PIs correctly. These are the first methods we are aware of that have done so, rather than underestimating the uncertainty considerably.

- The six pure ML methods that were submitted in the M4 all performed poorly, with none of them being more accurate than Comb and only one being more accurate than Naïve2. This supports the findings of the latest PLOS ONE paper by Makridakis, Spiliotis and Assimakopoulos.

"I have been reading 'How not to be wrong' by Jordan Ellenberg. The focus of the book is ""the hidden Maths of everyday life"" and many of his examples are based around statistics. This has prompted thought about how easily you can manipulate the opinions of someone who is not wary of statistics. A simple example I like is if you take a group of people, say 3 (person A, B and C), and set them the task of running a market stall. Who was the best? Shall we compare profit made. Say the overall group makes £10 profit and person A made £6 profit. Well then person A made over half the profit, so must had done best, right? I imagine you can see the flaw here. It could be that B made £10 profit, but C made a loss of £10. In this case B has in fact performed best. However, by with-holding the information it is easy to present the information in such a way as to favour person A and if you have a limited understanding of statistics (and a large portion of the population do struggle with stats) you could easily be manipulated.

It uses a simple linear model, based on the observation that the world record progression for most running events is linear.  In a previous article, I presented a model that tries to explain this pattern (and why we might expect it to continue):

3. ""Writing Instructional Material"" assignment, in which we try to describe the steps for performing a standard analysis.

In-Class Exercise: Write instructions for someone wishing to make a linear regression model and make some additional predictions from that model. Assume that the user has access to software like R, and has experience with it. Also assume that they don't know which statistics tests and plots are useful.



Yours should be about 200 words. The following example is more than 400 words, but shows a lot of what you could run into.



Example: Instructions for performing a one-way ANOVA, including diagnostics and post-hoc analysis.



1. Check if you data is of the proper type. The response/dependent variable should be a numerical quantity, and the explanatory/independent variable should be a categorical or grouping variable. If one of these isn't true, then ANOVA is not the analysis you want.



2. Check the extent of any missing data, if any. If there is some, you may want to remove cases with any missing data, or you may want to impute before continuing. Note that reliable imputation of the group or category may be impossible. Similar considerations may be needed for very small groups.



3. Check the residuals of the model from lm() for normality. Do this either by histogram, Q-Qplot, or a formal hypothesis test like Shapiro-Wilks or Anderson-Darling. If there is strong evidence of non-normality, follow the non-parametric route. Otherwise, follow the parametric route.





Parametric route

4. Use the lm() command to build a model of 'response ~ explanatory', and save that model. Use the anova() command on the saved model to get an anova table.



5. The p-value on the right of the ANOVA table is result of testing the hypothesis that all of the group means are equal. If this is small (smaller than some arbitrarily pre-selected alpha, such as 0.05), then continue to the post-hoc test in step 6.



6. Perform a Tukey test with the TukeyHSD() command. The differences in each pair of means will be shown in the output. The p-values for group differences are automatically adjusted to the number of groups and pairwise comparisons you have. The null hypotheses being tested in each case is if those two group means in the pair are equal. Any small p-values suggest 'honestly significant' differences between the means.





Non-Parametric route

4. Perform a Krusal-Walls test (a non-parametric ANOVA) on the data by using the kruskal.test() on 'response ~ explanatory' model. The null hypothesis being tested here is if the mean RANK of each group is the same.



5. The p-value given with the Krusal-Walls test indicates if there are any significant differences in the RANK mean of the groups. If this is small (smaller than some arbitrarily pre-selected alpha, such as 0.05), then continue to the post-hoc test in step 6.



6. Perform a Wilcoxon test on each pair of means and acquire a p-value for each. Compute an adjusted alpha from you initial family-wide alpha and a multiple testing adjustment such as the Bonferroni, Sidak correction. Alternatively, perform a non-parametric post-hoc test such as a Dunn's Test.

"I'm in a unique position.  I've completed a Ph.D. in Higher Ed, and finished numerous applied stats classes, such as those that would be offered in social sciences.  I did very well on all of those classes, but the interesting thing was that many of them were taught with an emphasis on formulas and the underlying mathematics behind stats.

Professors would say things like ""oh, yeah, you'd totally use SPSS for this, but I want you to work through the data set by hand so you learn the way the math works.""

Ironically, the previous stats course I had was almost 15 years earlier.

That said, I never quite learned, I think, about exactly WHEN to use particular stats.  So, for example, if a person says, here's what we want to find out, what process would we use?  I find myself completely befuddled.

Are there any books/lectures/primers, etc. out there that can help me fill in this gap in my knowledge?  Many of my texts were either too basic or focused too heavily on mathematics to give me the practicality of what I was learning...",Re-Learning Stats: Where Should I Start?,6f13uw,top,13,34,34,0
"I need to put together a really quick crash course on ANOVA for work.  I have about 30 minutes to talk about ANOVA and 30 minutes to demo stuff on JMP.

The assumption is that they will already understand hypothesis testing, and this is by no means meant to be academic, so I think it will be doable.   It's meant as a primer for the next class which will be a whopping 45 minutes on Design of Experiments.

Here's what I'm thinking of covering:

-analysis of ""variance"": is the difference explainable by the variance? Yadayada.

-Degrees of Freedom

-assumption of equal variance

-making levels wide enough to detect stuff (S/N), but not so wide you get screwed by curvature.  Also how it effects the assumption of equal variance

-you're never going to do a ""classical"" ANOVA just do a general linear model (engineering work/continuous variables)

-how to read the table (show how the degrees of freedom are assigned)

-dangers of multicolinearity

-if you get a multilevel categorical variable call an adult

-if you get a categorical response variable call an adult

-if there's a lot of money on the line call an adult.

Note: the main purpose of this is to promote a new stats department we are trying to build within the organization.  So we give people a quick rough outline of what they can do and how, while simultaneously sewing a bit of doubt in their minds about whether or not they are actually capable of doing it themselves.

Anyways, any other things you may think is worth covering.  I only get like 6 slides.

First of all, thank you everyone for your kind responses and support.  I wish I could've responded to all of you, but work the past 2 weeks have been kind of crazy.  

I got in touch with my old employer and they said they have a position open on their ""BI team"" for deploying a new data warehouse and BI solution.  It even pays more and comes with a bonus!

But here's the exciting part: they're planning to hire some SAS programmers and statistical analysts after our BI stack is developed and mature enough (probably a 1 year project). I'd be working with them, and they're willing to help me transition into their team!

I've become a little jaded over the past month so I'm a little skeptical when it comes to promises that aren't in writing.  But it beats doing sales.

"Something that's been bothering me more and more as I work is that there are a lot of people who claim to know a lot about stats who really don't.  I myself am someone who knows enough to know just how little I know, which is cliche, but true.   But I do know most of the fundamentals.

This isn't about testing someone's expertise, because there are so many levels of it out there.  I mean reading this subreddit is straight up daunting most days.   Its more about figuring out if they even understand the fundamentals.  There are a lot more ""cookbook statisticians"" floating around out there these days thanks to powerful software and the Data Science craze, people that figured out what buttons to press in JMP or what script to use in Python to run some fancy test, but have zero clue about the fundamental assumptions in play.   Like they could run a PCA but couldn't tell you what orthogonality meant (a bit of an extreme example).  Or they could run some ugly assed non-orthogonal/optimal design but couldn't read an aliasing map.  No joke I've seen the latter.  Turns out you only need 13 samples for 10 factors....  Or they don't know what the acronym NID means.  Whatever.

So what I'm trying to figure out is what are some simple questions you could ask that anyone at any level of real expertise with a solid fundamentals in stats should know, but someone who took a quick seminar or two would have no idea on.

Understand that this is 100% a ""shower arguments"" thing for me. I'm not going to take this list and go storm off and confront someone nor am I going to use it to feel smug and superior (like I said, I am *barely* middling *at best*).   I've just been dealing with a lot of cookbook dudes recently and it's been kind of grinding my gears.  And what scares me is that it's really hard to tell who's who.  I've taken directions from people before that I later found out didn't have a damn clue what they were really doing.  I'm legitimately concerned that very expensive decisions are being made at my company based on info these folks are giving.   I mean shit, maybe that's life?  These days though there's so much of this out there and I wonder how interviewers even ferret these guys out.  If they even do.

Anyways, what are some simple questions you could ask to test someone on fundamentals?   Here are a few I could think of:

-Name a biased and unbiased point estimator

-Given a distribution function f(x), how would you solve the Beta/Type 2 error risk, and what other info do you need?

-what's the difference between a binomial and hypergeometric distribution

-What's Bayes theorem, and could you write it out using Set Theory notation (intersections and unions only, admittedly this one would take me a minute)

Pretty much all of these are freshman-ish level, but I would like to think that most statisticians could answer these.  What are some other simple questions like this?

Or how else would you identify someone with weak fundamentals?

I feel weird asking this question, because it's going to sound really judgey and condescending, and I really don't want to act like I'm some kind of hot shit.  I am not, I'm straight up not very good.  But, as a young(ish) practitioner at the beginning of my career I'm getting very concerned with what I am seeing at my company.

"Dear statisticians,

I thought I understood PCA pretty well but after reading more about it on stat forums I'm getting more confused.

My understanding was that say if you have 10 variables (X1, ..., X10), going through the procedure of PCA you will get 10 eigenvalue/vectors. And those eigens will tell you which variables you can discard and still maintain a good portion of variance explained. So maybe in an example we want to retain x% of variance explained, where the value of x is a threshold chosen by the researcher. And PCA will tell the researcher to discard, perhaps X3 and X8, and the rest (X1,2,4,5,6,7,9,10) will provide x% of the original variance explained.

But after reading about it more, it sounds like PCA doesn't really ""discard"" variables. But rather create a new variable that is a linear combination of correlated variables.

Or perhaps this is also an incorrect understanding of PCA? Someone please help.

In addition, I would also like to know under what situation would a researcher choose PCA over FA, since both can be used for dimension reduction. I understand that FA can be used to measure unobservable variables. But under what circumstances would someone suspect there to be unobservable factors? Because theoretically can't you always argue there to be some underlying factors that can't be measured?

"I've been mentally kicking around this Gelman post for a few months:
http://andrewgelman.com/2015/07/09/hey-guess-what-there-really-is-a-hot-hand/

The relevant quote is 

> Jack takes a coin from his pocket and decides that he will flip it 4 times in a row, writing down the outcome of each flip on a scrap of paper. After he is done flipping, he will look at the flips that immediately followed an outcome of heads, and compute the relative frequency of heads on those flips. Because the coin is fair, Jack of course expects this conditional relative frequency to be equal to the probability of flipping a heads: 0.5. Shockingly, Jack is wrong. If he were to sample 1 million fair coins and flip each coin 4 times, observing the conditional relative frequency for each coin, on average the relative frequency would be approximately 0.4.

Umm. okay. I read the paper and decide that there's something to this hot hand thing -- It must be TRUE. But I'm conflicted. My old stats professor in college would go on and on about the hot hand fallacy -- It must be FALSE. Another professor says that we will always go back and forth on the existence of hot hand.

"Here is some information about my self so you can get a better idea about what exactly I'm aiming for in terms of an introduction into stats.

You can assume I am mathematically inclined. I have taken courses on multivariable calculus, introductory course to PDE's (heat equation & wave equation stuff), intro to complex variables, couple QM courses, intro to thermal physics, intro E&M, I also have some programming experience in C# and Python.

Now I am about to graduate and take a gap year working a job which will give me ample time to sit alone in an office and learn things on my own. I want to learn SQL, Python, and R. Im not too worried about the first two languages. Im actually not that worried about R in terms of learning the syntax. However I am worried about the lack of my knowledge in statistics.

So I am seeking a book that can give me a nice overview of everything stats, or as much as a newbie can understand, so that I can get the lay of the land and start to conceptualize some of the branches of statistics, some of the most useful methods etc. I thought that **daniel v schroeder thermal physics** was a good introductory text book for thermal physics, so if you know this book this is the type of pace that I would like to learn at. Any how Id just like something to give me a nice overview of the field so that I can specialize in certain branches at my discretion later on. I don't expect to find the holy grail of stats intro books or anything. Any and all input is welcome.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and help me. Please feel free to recommend any other books you may think I would find useful.

As a totally personal project over the last few days I have been working on a small - *small* - package for Julia that does some basic regressions (think STATA):

I recognize that it is quite the amateur work, but I am so far quite proud of the results (this is my first serious work developing a package in Julia, to be honest) and I wanted to share! 

The feature that this library aims for is *speed*: it executes all the main linear regression tasks (OLS, FGLS, Iterated GLS) quite fast, and works directly with Julia Arrays (no pesky abstractions). It even supports (in prototype) non-linear regressions through Optim.jl!

I am thinking of adding some more features, so I'd definitely like if more experienced folks took a look and gave me an honest feedback, spotting the errors/pain points I most certainly put in there. Suggestions are obviously welcome. Finally, if somebody wants to help it would be great!

I did these mainly because I was bored, I like data, and PhD data is easily accessible using the [Math Genealogy Project](https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/). I recently learned that the Math Genealogy project has data not just for Math departments, but also for Statistics and other fields, so I thought it would be fitting to do this data collection for a Statistics department. I chose Stanford to do this because it has been widely regarded as the 'top-ranked' Statistics Department for a long time, and I think it's interesting to see which universities produce the most faculty members that end up at top departments. Doing this sort of analysis for math departments also shed some light for me on just how difficult it is to become a tenure-track professor at a top institution. 

The following table shows data on where all tenure-track faculty (including Emeritus faculty) in the Statistics Department at Stanford received their PhDs (foreign universities have their country listed next to them):

Some comments:

1. Statistics Departments seem in general to be a lot smaller than Mathematics Departments, so there was less data for me to collect than when I did this analysis for math departments. For instance, Stanford only has 24 tenure-track faculty members in the Stat Department, but when I did this analysis for math departments, Stanford had 38 faculty members while MIT had 68. 

2. It probably isn't a surprise to you that Stanford and Berkeley, usually considered to be the top two Statistics Departments, are the two schools that produced the most Statistics faculty members at Stanford, with Stanford itself producing the highest number of faculty members. Harvard also has a very well-regarded Statistics Department, so it probably isn't too surprising to see Harvard in third place. However, I think there are a lot of fantastic Statistics Departments that are underrepresented/absent. For instance, UChicago, Carnegie Mellon, Duke, UPenn, etc. all have very respected and well-ranked Statistics Departments (all top 10 according to US News), but there are no faculty members from any of these schools. Columbia and Cornell are well-represented despite being ranked 20 and 24 respectively. 

3. Several faculty members/academic staff actually didn't get a PhD in Statistics. There were a fair number of people who got their PhDs in other affiliated fields, like Mathematics, Operations Research, Computer Science, etc. For instance, on the second table, there are schools like Princeton, MIT, etc. listed, and these schools don't even have a Statistics Department! One research associate in particular got a PhD in Government. There seems to be a wide range of disciplines that can lead to doing work in a Statistics Department.

3. The non-tenure track chart seems to have a more diverse selection of schools than the tenure-track chart. The tenure-track chart is a lot more 'top heavy' with mostly elite schools represented. This probably isn't surprising to you.

4. This is only one ""snapshot"" in time of the statistics faculty at Stanford. I make no claims about the historical trends of the PhD programs that faculty members there have attended. There aren't a great deal of data points due to the smaller faculty size, and the data set is probably too small to make any generalizations. I just did this mostly because I enjoy collecting and seeing this data, and I put it out there in case this data is interesting for you too. Someone better at programming than me could probably do this sort of data collection on a much wider scale, which I think it would be very interesting to see.

"I'm almost done with an internship where I had to do some statistical analysis and I'm panicking now that I'm realizing how little I know.

I'm currently enrolled in an undergrad program with a moderately-ranked graduate statistics department that I won't identify out of a very realistic fear of retaliation (Hi Jen!).  I've taken almost everything we have to offer because we only offer a single elective per semester.  Today I had to do a particular kind of analysis that we covered in one of my classes and I realized I didn't know how to literally any of it.  That class was taught by a professor who rambled for lecture and where your entire grade was several homeworks and a take-home final.

My time on here and viewing different blogs has shown me that Bayesian statistics are getting more and more important, but we have a very old-school department that doesn't have a single faculty member with a background in the subject.  I think I've spent one lecture here on the topic.  We cover Monte Carlo methods but never actually apply them.  We see them on a blackboard and never touch them again.  I've used R in a grand total of one class where the book required it.  There's absolutely zero computational statistics in our department.  It's all theoretical (frequentist of course) and experimental design-oriented, and I don't want to go into research. Like I think theory is important and that it's flat-out dangerous for people to do statistics without understanding it, but I think there's a point where it's taught at the expense of everything else. I've also never seen data mining or machine learning techniques in any of my classes, but I'm not sure how common that is.

Furthermore, with one exception, I've never been given a project to apply my skills to.  It's all random book problems and number plugging for applied classes without the use of anything outside an elementary software package on occasion.  I don't have any kind of a ""data analysis portfolio"" and have no idea what I'll show potential employers when they ask what I've worked on.

I'm working on an internship this summer where I was handed a data set and asked to draw conclusions and I realized I had literally no idea where to start.  No one had ever shown me how to adjust models or penalize them.  I had to sit there on my own and flail for weeks because I was the only one with a statistical background there and I still have no idea if I taught myself the material correctly, even though I'm okay with linear algebra and some graduate material.

Is this a common experience for you guys?  Am I overreacting or should I not expect to truly know what I'm doing until I get a graduate degree?  How much of this is my department versus my internship and what's expected of me in the professional world?  Sorry if this sounds really rambly.  Thank you so much!

"I think I've noticed a trend regarding Reddit comments and I'm just curious to see what a visual representation of the data in question would look like.  I have no stat background so apologies in advance.  The trend I'm curious about quantifying and visualizing is this:

The top comment on many front page Reddit posts has a lot of upvotes.  Then the top response to the top comment has a lot too but significantly fewer.  Then the response to that top response even fewer, and so on.  So I'll be making a few visualizations, but right now have data for two separate top comment strains per post, for 100 'front page' Reddit posts across 3 subreddits.


Since Reddit provides me with ""x hours ago"" next to each comment too, I want to control for the fact that posts' comments/replies that have been around longer have had a longer time to accumulate upvotes.  In other words, the reply of a reply of a reply to the top comment might not have too many upvotes *not* because no one agrees, but rather it's *too new to have accumulated 1000 upvotes like the top comment*, which was posted just minutes after the main link itself was posted.  

So just using averages and not thinking about the time element at all, I get something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/KEVN7P8.png)....but I want to incorporate the ""time since posting"" because I collected info on it (in ""hours since posted"").  What's a proper way to do this?

2. If I were to reject a null hypothesis with a certain p-value, would my error probability not be the same as my p-value? For example: p = 0.01, alpha = 0.05 leads to rejection of the the null hypothesis. What is my error probability? Is it 0.05 or 0.01?

**I believe:**

- If you flip a coin 219,000 times, you should have 50.0% heads; 50.0% tails.  (Anything else would be HIGHLY unlikely.)

**My coworker believes:**

- If you flip a coin 219,000 times, it would not be unusual to bet something like 49.0% heads; 51.0% tails.

**Context:**

We have a website that is running an A/B test.  Banner 1 should appear 50% of the time.  Banner 2 should appear 50% of the time.

We've had 219,000 hits.  Banner 1 appeared 110,100 times.  Banner 2 appeared 109,600 times.  Banner 1 has had about 500-600 more views since the page has had 10,000 views.

I think - if it were TRULY random - it would be highly unlikely that the banners would have a difference of 500 views.  I think the numbers should be much closer, given the large sample size.

He says it's not unusual, and that with 219,000 hits, a difference of 500 is perfectly normal.

(I would agree with him if the number of hits was lower.)

"I recently created a simple program to simulate the efficacy of random lynching in the game Town of Salem (Do play it; it's super fun). I tested different numbers of townies, mafiosi, and serial killers and such. The results were predictable - unless there is only one enemy, random lynching is a bad idea.

However, the weirdest phenomenon caught my eye. When there was only *one* godfather, you are more likely to win if you have an odd number of townies than an even number of townies. I have no clue why this is, and I'd really like to know if this is actually the case and why, or if it's some weird bug with my program.

My program simplifies the game a bit since it's a bit hard to simulate all the different roles, so the program works like this:

* Start with 1 godfather and 11 townies
* (Nighttime)
* godfather kills 1 townie
* (Daytime)
* everyone votes to execute a random person. If it is just one townie and the godfather, then the vote fails because there is no majority and nobody gets executed.
* if the executed is the godfather the townies win, otherwise it's nighttime again
* if only the godfather is left then the mafia wins

My program ran the game 10,000 times with different numbers of townies but always 1 godfather and gave the following:

* 1 gf, 11 townies - 62.78% town wins
* 10 - 50.75%
* 9 - 59.52%
* 8 - 45.03%
* 7 - 54.41%
* 6 - 37.45%
* 5 - 46.10%
* 4 - 25.16%
* 3 - 33.57%
* 2 - 0.00%
* 1 - 0.00%
* 0 - 0.00%

Running each of these possibilities again always seems to give similar percentages.

If the program acted like this in other combinations of mafiosi and serial killers I'd pass it off as a bug but it only acts like this with EXACTLY one godfather. With other combinations, the likelihood of the town winning decreases as there are fewer townies, as expected.

So I decided to create a *second* program fine-tuned to *just* one godfather and a certain number of townies and it gives me the same data.

So my questions are:

* Is this actually true or is this some weird bug in my program?
* Why?! Instinct tells me that if there are more townies, then the townies can make more wrong guesses before screwing themselves, but then again this could be some weird quirk of math I'm not aware of. How do 7 townies fare better than 10?!

"I was taught that a p-value tells you how likely it is that your observed effect is due to chance, but [a recent statement from the American Statistical Association (ASA)](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108) states that this is incorrect. That's fine, but I still don't quite understand what *is correct*. Here's a few excerpts from the statement:

*""Informally, a p-value is the probability under a specified statistical model that a statistical summary of the data (for example, the sample mean difference between two compared groups) would be equal to or more extreme than its observed value.* 

*[...]* ***P-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone.*** *[...] It is a statement about data in relation to a specified hypothetical explanation, and is not a statement about the explanation itself.""*

***EDIT:*** I see now that a p-value only measures the probability of getting any one result *given that a specified null hypothesis is true.* It's a subtle difference on paper, but it obviously makes a huge practical difference; it won't be able to tell you anything about whether your alternative hypothesis is true or not.

but i **don't** want to be another one of the inpatient MD researchers, fishing for p-values, impossible to work with and publishing crap. the idea that we have so much flawed science published daily is highly unsettling. and honestly, the more stats i learn, the more i realize the value in adequate database planning and experimental setup. so my questions for you guys are these (please forgive my ignorance):

1. what kinds of bad behaviors/ways of thinking do you guys most commonly encountered with MDs and how can i avoid them? 
2. why do i keep hearing SPSS is ""not powerful enough"" compared to SAS? could someone ELI5?

"I'm still not quite sure what the point of transforming data to the normal distribution is useful for, even though it seems to be recommended operation anytime you look up ""non-normal data"".  


For instance, say I have taken a sample and it seems fairly obvious that the data is log-normal. I could transform the data to a normal distribution, and perform some normal hypothesis tests such t-tests or ANOVA. The purpose of hypothesis tests is to set an acceptable significant threshold for alpha error (typically .05), and test with the assumption that, if the null hypothesis is true, that is your chance for a false positive. Isn't that lost once you transform your data?  For example a data point may fall beyond the significant threshold if it was transformed, but it wouldn't fall beyond that threshold in the original distribution. In this case my ability to predict the false positive rate, even in the case where i'm sure the null hypothesis is true is destroyed.  


It would seem to me that the correct procedure would to always try to estimate what the true population distribution is, and base thresholds based on percentile ranges from it's true distribution rather than transform the data.

"As someone who was introduced to statistics primarily as a tool within social psych and similar behavioral research, and as a young PhD student who is getting increasingly disheartened by poorly performed research, I've taken an interest in reading critiques of social science research and in particular the misuse of statistics.

Gelman of course has had a lot to say about this, and I've enjoyed going through his blog. One thing that I don't feel like I quite understand though is his paper [*The garden of forking paths: Why multiple comparisons can be a problem,
even when there is no ""fishing expedition"" or ""p-hacking""*](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf).

I understand the issue with fishing expeditions, certainly, but he seems to explicitly say he's not talking about researchers intentionally running test after test to find significant results. In some cases, I understand the arguments against some of the specific studies he mentions. For example, in section 2.1, he mentions a study claiming a finding about an interaction effect, and goes on to explain that the authors didn't seem to think carefully about this effect and other confounding variables.

But I'm having a hard time understanding the larger conceptual point Gelman is trying to make in this paper about ""data-dependent analyses."" He provides many examples with the studies he criticizes to explain how different findings could have been framed in a different way had the data been different. For example:

> For example, as noted above, it would seem completely consistent with Beall and Tracy’s model of sexual signaling if college women, at the height of their fertility, were to be dressing in a way consistent with their ovulation cycle, while older women (many of whom would be married) would not feel that subconscious need to attract the male gaze. The opposite story would also fit: it would make sense that college women—who are often sexually active and want to avoid getting pregnant—would subconsciously *avoid* sending sexual messages
during their most fertile times—whereas older women would send these signals more urgently.

This makes sense to me, but I'm not quite understanding how this is problematic if we are also assuming that researchers are only performing one test and not fishing by running multiple tests. If a researcher, in the example above for example, hypothesized that younger women dressed in a way consistent with their ovulation cycle and older women did not, then it wouldn't matter if they found that the opposite was true. They could just report that their hypothesis was wrong, right?

I guess I'm having trouble because near the beginning of the paper, he seems to indicate that he's not accusing researchers of being unethical and chasing significant results (or am I wrong about this?) But I don't understand how his argument in the rest of the paper is not accusing researchers of exactly that.

"I'm a first year Master's student in Statistics, and this semester I've been trying to prioritize doing some coding and modeling using some data sets I think are fun to start building some kind of portfolio for my future job hunt since I don't think my class projects are all that interesting for an employer to read through.

So my question is this: How/where would you recommend uploading informal reports on these data sets and models?  I know for the code specifically GitHub is a great tool.  I'd like to write (informally) about my side projects about what my goal was for the model, what I ended up with, and then details about my procedure and thought process for building it, diagnostics, a discussion of the assumptions, etc.  If you're hiring someone, would you rather that be formatted in a ""Read Me"" at the bottom of the project/code page on GitHub even if it is fairly long?  Would you be more interested in being linked to a blog where I've written blog posts about these models instead?  Or is there some other good option?


And also, as a related question: As an employer are you necessarily looking for ""highly successful"" models in these hobby side projects, I guess in terms of predictive power?  I ask because for my current for fun project, it turns out even my best model using the data I gathered, while significant, doesn't really explain much of the variance at all and thus isn't really very useful.  But I'm prepared to write quite a bit about what I think went wrong, confounding variables to consider collecting if I try again with the same goal in the future, and other things like that.  Does it make me look bad that I ""settled"" with a not very useful model instead of waiting and posting one after finding a more useful model after finding more data?  Or can it still be valuable to post the not useful model to write about my modeling process, etc so you can assess my coding, modeling, thought process, and so on?

I'd now like to try to cement what I've learned by working through some problems that I should be able to solve using PyMC. Can anyone suggest a good (pref free) place to find such problems?

**Edit**: Thanks for all of the refs. I found a couple more along the way. There are lots of good examples in the [OpenBUGS documentation/examples section](http://openbugs.net/w/Examples). The [Healthy Algorithms blog](http://healthyalgorithms.com/tag/pymc/) also has lots of good examples that the author has worked through.",Third reference for learning Bayesian statistics?,2qv2al,top,11,29,29,0

"I feel like I lack the background or at least context to understand the fervor over this new tool. I've managed to gather a few ""facts,"" but I don't really know what they mean.

* Stan does Bayesian inference of some kind. 
* Stan uses a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sample (HMC), which is some kind of variant on Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling (MCMC). (If anyone wants to go into some depth on MCMC, HMC, and how they are used in bayesian inference, that would be cool. I'm new to this)
* BUGS is one of the standard tools for Bayesian inference. There are certain problems that are intractable in BUGS that Stan is capable of resolving.

I guess my question is pretty big. In short: what kinds of things would I want to use Stan to model? What are some things that Stan can do that BUGS can't? What are some things that BUGS does well? What is the need that Stan is filling? Why is everyone so excited?

"I have historically held courses on performing ""classic"" statistics in R, like regression models, hypothesis tests and the like. These were chiefly aimed at people who already knew a bit about R.

This fall, I have been recruited to hold a university course on R for beginners, i.e. people with no prior experience. Perhaps they have no experience with programming at all, and they may come from many different, but academic fields. Their statistical knowledge also varies.

I already have some ideas for my course, but I want to make it highly enjoyable and current (for example, I plan on teaching dplyr, data.table and ggplot2 to name just a few great ""new"" packages). The course lasts five days and will be entirely centered around actually using R; i.e. there are no big ""theory sessions"".

"I want to solve a statistics problem, but the mathematics is a bit beyond my training. I have tried to find the topic that would help me figure it out (and I learned some very interesting mathematics along the way), but I haven’t found a satisfactory solution for me. I’m hoping that you can help:

I want to evaluate the claims of advocates for a relatively new personality inventory. The university where I teach is considering using this inventory for our incoming students.

Spoiler alert (without saying what it is):

a.	The rationale for the test is ridiculous. Because I don’t want to expose myself to any legal trouble, you’re going to have to trust me on this one.

b.	It fails every test of a scientific evaluation. At the very least, it’s neither testable nor falsifiable.

c.	It cannot be validated.

d.	It gives the subject a “result”, but there is no way to confirm that it has any evidential value.

e.	Even if it had evidential value, the subjects are 17-to-18-year-old university students, who will be very different people by the time we graduate them, or we wouldn’t be doing our jobs as professors.

f.	It has no predictive value, at least that anyone dares to claim.

g.	These are the best things that I can say about it.

Okay, now that you know that I’m completely unbiased and objective…

One of the characteristics of flim-flam artists, snake oil salesmen, and other false prophets of scientific truth is that they make over-the-top, fantastic, can’t-possibly-be-right claims about the things that they want us to accept.

That, and they want our money. Lots of it, as a matter of record.

These guys are clearly trying for the latter. I’m trying to expose the former as false, with a little more rigor than name-calling.

The inventory consists of a bit more than 400 pairs of statements about personality, of which a randomly selected subset of approximately 175 pairs is presented to the subject. The subject is asked to indicate the level of agreement with one or the other on an integer scale of 1 to 5, where “1” is strongest agreement with the first statement, and “5” is strongest agreement with the second.

After the subject makes their choices, a proprietary algorithm generates a result, ranking the subject on 34 personality dimensions, such as “Caring”, “Empathetic”, “Quixotic”, etc. If you pay the standard, nominal fee for taking the test, you get a report of the 5 dimensions where the subject scored the highest, complete with detailed, horoscope-like descriptions of these five personality dimensions. For an additional fee, the subject can get the report in the same format, but showing the top ten dimensions. And, wouldn’t you know it, for even more money, the subject can get the complete list of all 34 dimensions, listed from “most like you”, to “least like you”.

I was asked to sit through a seminar, presented by representatives of the organization that created this tool. In it, the claim is made that retesting of this inventory is discouraged, mostly because their “studies” have shown that, while there is some variability in the top five personality dimensions, the second top five is, on average, contained in the first top ten, with a hit rate of 98%.

I should mention here, that I did some research into how the test is administered, and I can report that if you take the inventory a second time, the subset of about 175 pairs is reselected from the larger set by “resampling with replacement”. In other words, it’s all but a certainty that there will be items from the second test that appeared in the first.

At any rate, when I heard this 98% figure, I nearly jumped out of my chair, to expose this lie. And because I’m asking for a mathematics favor from you, let me tell you a little something about psychology:

If that 98% figure was real, and reproducible across ANY demographic and/or time, it would be the biggest sensation in personality assessment. Ever. It would be hard to invent the superlatives that would be necessary to describe it. Private-sector organizations would pay insane amounts of money to license it. It would revolutionize all kinds of disciplines such as vocational assessment and project management, which are languishing under the intellectual burden of low reproducibility. Even the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (many decades old, and arguably, the gold standard in this area) measures about a dozen personality dimensions, with a test-retest reproducibility of about 0.50 to about 0.80. I’ve seen test-retest reliability for the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator as high as about 0.80, but that’s all.

This claim was one of many that are outrageous, and I seriously considered betting real money on this. But then I considered that I didn’t know the actual odds of my success. So I held my tongue until there was a break in the presentation, made my argument to students who also figured this out by the social psychology argument, and tried to calculate the odds by myself. I couldn’t do it with any confidence (pun intended).

Here are my questions:

1.	What is the likelihood that, in a sample of “N” subjects who take this inventory exam twice, that “X” items in the top five of the 34 dimensions measured by the second test (“X” is an integer, such that 5 >= X >= 0) are found among the top ten dimensions of the first test, if the reproducibility of the inventory is some value “Y” (1 >= Y >= 0)?
2.	Am I on the right track to suppose that this is a Bayesian problem, with the claimed hit rate of 98% being the prior? As a recovering frequentist, if it is, can you advise me as to the technique for testing this prior?
3.	If there is a straightforward statistical test of the 98%-hit-rate claim, is there a way to calculate the adjustment in the payout odds if I reduce the hit rate requirement? In other words, if I was going to wager even money on a test of the 98% claim, what reduced hit rate can I offer, to justify, say, a Z:1 payout in my favor (Z > 1), given the conditions of the inventory as described above?
4.	If I am totally off-base here, what is the right way to think about this problem, and test the data from repeated measures of this inventory tool?

On a side note, I’d like to mention that, in the course of trying to study enough probability to solve this on my own, I came across the topic of rencontres numbers, which I must confess, I still don’t understand as well as I should, but it’s so darn interesting, and it has the most interesting application to concepts that are closely related to the one that I’m struggling with now.

But I digress.

Can anyone help me with the probability mathematics of this inventory problem, or at least identify the topics that I should be learning, so that I can figure this out?

Many thanks in advance for your time and consideration.

Some more context:

* This would leave me roughly $50-$80k in debt (Depending on how much my living expenses are, and how much I'll have saved.) I don't have any debt currently. 

* I know I want kids, so my main objection to the debt is that I'd still be paying it off while I have them (24 currently, will be lucky to pay it off in 10 years)--and I'd really rather spend that money on my kids. 

* My other option is to get a PhD at a fairly high-ranked university (roughly equal to UCLA). So I wouldn't have to go into debt! Except it's far from everyone I know, including my boyfriend, who I want to stay with. And 5 years is a long time.

* Bonus question! I do think I'd want to get a PhD eventually. Would an M.S. from UW help me get into a better PhD program?
