"TL;DR: learned a buncha shit in 20 months with no prior anything-related experience, got job as data scientist

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


Edit: Seems like this was removed from r/learnprogramming. Trying to direct all the PMs to come here

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


First, I want to thank the entire reddit community because without this place I wouldn’t have went down the rabbit hole that is self-learning, job searching, and negotiation. 

&nbsp;


Second, just to list out my background so people know where I started and how I got here: I graduated in 2013 with a bachelor’s in civil engineering (useless in this case) and again in 2015 with a master’s in operations research (much more useful, namewise at least) both from the same top school. The name of the school and the operations research degree opened up quite a few doors in the beginning of my (2-year) career, and definitely was a factor in getting an interview, but had nothing to do directly with what was needed for the Data Science job. This is because that offer was contingent on a programming skillset and specific data science problem-solving abilities, of which I had none right after graduation.

&nbsp;

The most useful advice to keep in mind: keep trying, keep learning, don’t be afraid to switch jobs when you’re bored or it’s not what you want, continuously look for new opportunities, and always negotiate. I went from a 47k job where I lasted only 4 months, to a 65k job where I lasted just under a year, to a 90k job where I stayed 10 months, to my new job at 115k. All in under 2 and a half years. Strap yourself in, this will be long!


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Step 1:**


Get your first real job out of college, realize how much you loathe it, feel entitled because they’re not paying you for your amazing theoretical prowess that isn’t really useful, realize that you were meant to do much more cool shit, and convince yourself that you need a higher paying job.


My first job out of grad school lasted 4 months. It was an analyst title, which I thought was awesome because I had no idea what analysts do, but it was mostly bitchwork and data entry. The one upside was that my boss mentioned a pivot table once, and I googled it, so I finally learned what it was. But I still figured I was too smart for this shit so I looked for other jobs because I needed something to challenge me.


Congrats, you now have the drive to get your ass to a better role!


&nbsp;


**Step 2:**


I got into the adtech industry after my 4-month stint, they liked me because of that pivot table thing I learned to do /s. This is where the data science itch began, but I knew I wouldn’t be satisfied in the long run. As pompous as it is to keep saying I was too smart for this shit, I was. I just needed the tools to show that.


The amount of data that lives in the industry is insane, and it’s always good to mention how much data you’ve worked with. This place is where you earn your SQL, Excel, and Tableau medals. You edit some dashboards, you pivot and slice data, you don’t necessarily write your own complex queries from scratch but you know how they look like and know what joins do.


By no means was I going to do any advanced stuff at work so I needed to start doing it on my own if I wanted to grow. In my time at this job (after work but also during work. Use your down time wisely!), I took MIT’s Intro to Comp Sci with Python, Edx’s Analytics Edge, and Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning. This set up the foundation but since they were all intro courses, I couldn’t apply the knowledge. There were still a bunch of missing pieces.


But! At least I got started. Towards the end of my time there I found rmotr.com through reddit. I finished the advanced python programming course, which was incredibly difficult for me at the time because of the knowledge density and intensity. I highly recommend it if you want to learn more advanced python methodologies and applications, and also if you’re leaning towards the development side.


&nbsp;


**Step 3:**


I left my last company of a few thousand people, where everything was essentially fully established, and moved to a smaller company of 100ish people. There was more opportunity to build and own projects here, and it’s where I earned my dev, analytics, and machine learning medals. This is where classes will continue to aid in your learning, but where google and stackoverflow will help you actually BUILD cool shit. You will have thousands of questions the classes won’t be able to answer, so your searching skills will greatly improve in this time.


During my time here I completed Coursera UMichigan’s Intro to Data Science with Python. I completed it relatively quickly and from what I recall, it wasn’t too challenging. 


After that course, I stumbled on Udemy and completed Jose Portilla’s Python for Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp, which was a turning point from knowledge to application. This class is a must. It’s how I learned to neatly organize my data frames, manipulate them very easily, and, thanks to google and stackoverflow, how to get all that data into csv and excel sheets so I can send them to people. It doesn’t sound like much, but data organization and manipulation was the #1 worthwhile skill I learned. It’s also where I learned to implement all machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn, and a bit of deep learning. There wasn’t much theory behind it, which was perfectly fine, because I was going for 100% application.


This is also where I took advantage of the training reimbursement at work- I kept buying courses and it was free! During this time I also completed Stanford’s Statistical Learning course on their Lagunita platform (good for knowledge base), the first three courses of Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (it was a breeze because it was in python and I had a deep understanding of dataframes by this time, also very good for knowledge base and algorithm implementation from scratch), and another Udemy class from Jose Salvatierra called the Complete PostgreSQL and Python Developer Course- also a game changer. It was the first course I had on clean python code for software development. The way he thinks is outstanding and I highly recommend it.


&nbsp;


**Step 4: Resume Building and Linkedin**


There are articles out there that can explain this a lot better than I can, but here were my steps to have my resume and Linkedin Ready:


*Resume*


1.	Kept the resume to one page, had it look more modern, sleek, and fresh (even had dark grey and blue colors) 

2.	Under my name, listed my email, number, github, and linkedin across the entire width of the page


3.	Recent work experience on top. Descriptions included what technology I used (python, impala, etc.) to do something (built multiple scrapers, python notebooks, automated reporting, etc.) and the effect (saved hours of manual work for account managers, increased revenue day over day by X, etc). This can be easily remembered by saying I used X to do Y with the Z results.


Note: Not all of my descriptions had results. My last listed job on my resume only had the support work I did- I supported accounts totaling X revenue monthly, partook in meetings with clients, etc. Not every task has a quantifiable outcome but it’s nice to throw some numbers in there when you can.


4.	I read in some places that no one would care about this, but I did it anyway, and listed all courses and bootcamps I had finished by that time, which was around 8. While I had some projects I had done at work I could speak to, I wanted them to know that I was really dedicated to learning everything I could about the field. And it worked!

5.	Below that was my education- both degrees listed without GPAs


6.	And lastly, active interests. Maybe old-school corporations don’t care for things like this, but for start-uppy tech companies that are in a growth stage, I figured they’d like to see my what I do on the side. I’ve been competitively dancing for almost a decade and weightlifting for more than that, so if being a dancing weightlifting engineering-background guy makes me seem more unique, I’m going for it. Whatever makes you stick out!

*Linkedin*

1.	Professional-looking photo. Doesn’t have to be professional, just professional-looking.

2.	Fill out everything LinkedIn asks you to fill out so you can be an all-star and appear in more searches. The summary should include a shitload of keywords that relate to what you’ve done and what you want to do. Automation, analytics, machine learning, python, SQL, noSQL, MS-SQL, throw all that shit in there.


3.	I only filled out the description for my most recent job because that’s where I actually did cool shit. I put a lot more detail here in LinkedIn than I did on my resume. Then I listed the 3-4 jobs I had before that, no description

4.	Put all my certifications from the courses I took with links


5.	Put my education, obvs

6.	The rest…eh. Doesn’t really matter.


&nbsp;


**Step 5: Job Search**


So you have your nice and shiny resume ready, and your LinkedIn set to go. This is where the entirety of your hard work will be rewarded. How badly do you want this job?


I stopped using indeed, monster, etc. a long while ago. 


The single tool I used was and still is Glassdoor. Download a PDF copy of your resume to your phone or a cloud drive, search on Glassdoor ON THE DAILY. Keep saved searches ready to go- “junior data scientist”, “data scientist”, “senior analytics”, “senior data analyst”, “junior machine learning”, “entry data science”, and so on. When you’re on the bus or laundromat or in bed late at night and can’t sleep, look for openings. Filter by the rating you’re willing to take on and apply like mad. I got dozens of applications done just from waiting at the laundromat. All the calls I had after were 100% from Glassdoor applications.


&nbsp;


**Step 6: The initial call**


I’ve had 3 total initial calls from the probably 50 or so applications I sent over the summer (very few openings that didn’t require 5+ years of java and machine learning product dev etc. etc. and largely distributed blah blah where I live).


Here were most of the things I was asked:


•	What tools I used at work 


•	How have I made processes more efficient at work


•	Anything I’ve automated 


•	Largest amount of data I worked with and what was the project and result


•	Why the shift from the current job


•	How much I know about their company and how I’d describe the company so someone else (do your research!)


I had 100% success on my initial calls. Each time mentioned some sort of python, automated scripts (simply by using windows task scheduler and batch file- thanks to google search!), and a data manipulation project (highest I’ve had is a few million rows), and I was good to go.


&nbsp;


**Step 7: The data exercise**


From those 3 initial calls, I had 2 exercises sent via email and one via Codility.


The first exercise was SQL and visualization heavy. I was given a SQLite database to work from and had to alter tables to feed into other tables to aggregate other metrics and so on. Once that was done, I had to use the resulting tables to do some visualizations and inference.


Did I know how to do most of what they asked? Hell no. I had google and stackoverflow open for every little detail I didn’t know how to do off the top of my head. The entire thing took about 20-25 hours spread across the week and even when I submitted it didn’t feel complete. I couldn’t afford not to put all my free time into this exercise.


The end result: the hiring manager and team was impressed with the code, but they didn’t vibe with the presentation style of my jupyter notebook and it was very apparent that I lacked the domain knowledge required (this was for a health tech company, and I have no health anything experience). It actually prompted them to re-post with an altered job description requiring domain knowledge. Woo? Regardless, this served as a huge source of validation for me- these senior level members thought my code was good. 


The second exercise was from the company I ultimately accepted. It was 3-4 hours in total to assess business intelligence skills (SQL and visualization). They liked it and I moved on to the in-person, which I’ll go into in the next step.


The last exercise was codility- and while my code “worked”, there was likely some test cases I didn’t account for. Either that or the company got irritated when I said I received an offer and if they could speed up the process. They didn’t follow through.


&nbsp;


**Step 8: The in-person interview**


So you got to this stage! Congrats!


And you’ll be interviewing with 3 VPs, 2 C-level execs, and 2 data scientists. Jesus fuck, you’ve never met this many executives in your whole life.


No need to freak out. This simply validates your hard work. You’ll be meeting with very important people for a very important job, and they think you might be good at it. 


Even if I hadn’t made it past this, I tasted victory.


I did something that may not be recommended by most people: I didn’t prepare for questions they’d ask me, but rather prepared for all the questions I’d ask them. This did two things: I didn’t obsess about what they’d ask me so I was relaxed, and it gave me a lot of chances to show I knew my shit when I asked them a bunch of stuff. Besides, for a data science job, I figured they’d ask questions about how I’d solve some problems they currently have, as opposed to some common questions. And that’s exactly what they did. Not something you can really prepare for the night before, since it’s a way of thinking you’d have to grasp through all the classes and projects and problems you solved at your current job.


IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not advocating ignoring prepping for questions. I did about 30-35 interviews, phone and in person, before my current job so I had a lot of learning experience. I already had a more natural-feeling response for most questions. And if you really were into your projects at your current job, you’ll know what you did inside out, so it’s easier to talk about it on the spot. But by all means, if you don’t have much interview experience, prepare and practice!


Here are my notes from after the interviews, including what was asked and how I answered, and what I asked:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP of Data Science**

&nbsp;

•	*Notice any hiccup in your exercise?* I debated with him on the accuracy of a single statement in the exercise, assuring him that since I used a Hadoop-based query engine and they used AWS, my method worked every time I used it. I never checked whether he or I was right because afterwards I started thinking he was right and didn’t want to feel like an idiot. But we moved on rather quickly.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you implement typo detection?* I gave a convoluted response but put simply, some distance index between words. As in, how many changes would it take to get to the word we may want. He liked the answer because it’s what he was thinking too.

&nbsp;

•	*How’s your style of explaining things to people?* Very logical step-by-step process with the goal of weaning people off needing me. I’d explain it to them completely, then next time leave a few steps missing and ask if they’d remember, then eventually just give them a step or two.

&nbsp;

•	*What’s something you want to be better at?* Being more personable when explaining technical terms to non-tech people

&nbsp;

Then I went crazy with a ton of questions about what projects they’re working on, what’s the first thing I’d be working on, the challenges they have currently, how do they interact with the sales team, and so on.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP Tech**

&nbsp;

•	*So, data! Tell me about it.* I told him that I love it, I’m excited by it, and I wana get better at it.

&nbsp;

•	*What as a process you made more efficient at work.* Created an automated process using a batch file to run python script via task scheduler. It scrapes an internal web tool and creates reporting that otherwise doesn’t exist, which saves hours for the account managers weekly.

&nbsp;

•	*So you aimed towards a process that would essentially take something that’s not working too well, fix it, and productionalize it?* Why yes, yes indeed.

&nbsp;

•	*So that kind of sounds like a software development mentality.* Absolutely, and eventually after I have a lot of exposure to the research side of data science I’d like to get more into a machine learning engineering role to build everything out.

&nbsp;

•	*Cool man!*

&nbsp;

He probably liked that I wasn’t purely analytics, but also built tools to solve problems not related to data science.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**COO, President** 


•	*What are areas do you think you need development in?* Being more on the business side of things, as I tend to like delving deep into my code to make things work I sometimes get delayed info of the overall business health.

&nbsp;

•	*Do you have any entrepreneurial experience?* I said nope, to which he responded with “Nothing? Not even selling lemonade?”. Then it jogged my memory of when I tried to sell yugioh and pokemon cards at the pool when I was young, with my binder of sheets with prices too high so no one would buy. He had a laugh and said it was a good answer because the simple experience in learning the prices were too high was a lesson.

&nbsp;

•	*What are you looking for?* Something challenging, where I won’t be just a SQL monkey (this term was thrown around by a lot of the team, so I kept repeating it and made references to who mentioned it to show that I’m paying attention), where there will be big issues to solve across the company, and a place where I’d be doing something meaningful. In this case, it was helping local businesses thrive, and I’m all for that. I’m coming from an adtech background, so the emphasis was very clear on the “finding meaning” part.

&nbsp;

•	*If that's the case, why this company?* I liked that they were VERY fast with their interview process. I told him that and that it shows a lot about the company and how much they care to get things done. 

&nbsp;

•	*What was your proudest moment?* Told him about the first time I built a tool that helped the business, which was at my current company. The year or so of effort learning python and databases and manipulating dataframes led to a really cool scraping project that now seems rather novice, but I couldn’t contain my excitement when I accomplished it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Data Scientists**


Sit and chat. I asked them questions about how they like it there, what projects they worked on, etc. Very laid back.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**VP Marketing (first form)**


This was the one guy who really grilled me with problem solving questions. 

&nbsp;

•	*Why did google decide to build out their own browser?* This is where my background in adtech helped. I listed almost everything I could about user data, selling to advertisers, tracking users, etc. He thought those were good answers, but it wasn’t what he was looking for. He asked me the next leading question.

&nbsp;

•	*What was so good about chrome compared to IE?* I stumbled on this since I never could really compare it fully to internet explorer since I never used IE, I just knew people said it sucked. With some guidance I answered correctly: faster load times.

&nbsp;

•	*And what does that mean?* I took a few seconds of thought and answered correctly, that google wants their search pages to load faster.

&nbsp;

From there, he pulled some stats about google CPC and rates from another country and asked me how much would google make in capturing a certain percent of the internet explorer user market. My process was correct, but the multiplication was off in the end. A bit embarrassing, but at least I owned it and made some jokes about division by hand. Got the correct answer after.


That concluded the first in-person interview. Got called for another in-person and I was shitting myself because I thought maybe they didn’t get enough information. I was much more nervous for this one, but once the interviews started I was calm and confident.

&nbsp;

**CMO** 

&nbsp;

•	*What are some of areas that you need development in?* Same as I said before- business side things.

&nbsp;

•	*Why the short tenure in your old jobs (4 months, 12 months, 9 months)?* THIS is where you have to show yourself as the ever-growing, constant-learning, autodidact with insatiable appetite to learn. I told him I learn on my own outside of work, I apply that knowledge to build cool shit, and that I outgrow my positions very quickly so I needed something more challenging. I backed it up with the projects I completed.

&nbsp;

•	*What'll be the biggest challenge you'll face here?* Data Science team structure- sprints, prioritizing the right projects, etc. Haven’t experienced it before so I’d have to learn how to operate within that structure.

&nbsp;

•	*What would your current boss say about you?* I explained that I have sort of two bosses, one tech and one nontech. The tech one would say I can take an idea and run with it to build a tool. The nontech would say I’m very helpful and available asap when he needs me.

&nbsp;

•	*What would they say you need improvement on?* Nontech boss- business side of things. Tech boss- get more into the details of adtech, like which scripts are executed on the page, how it relates to different servers, etc.

&nbsp;

•	*What would your last boss say about you?* Always learning on the job

&nbsp;

•	*What's one example of when you thought outside the box?* Gave example of how the data engineering team was backed up and couldn’t ingest some third party data, so I used python to ingest the data 6-8 weeks before they could do it. I also explained that while the process was essentially the same (extract, transform, load) I thought outside the box by not relying on the team assigned with the task and figured out my own way to do it. He thought that was an excellent example.

&nbsp;

•	*What was your proudest moment?* Same answer as before

&nbsp;

•	*Why the move?* Current company is pivoting, has been for 8 months but not much to show for it, a lot of senior leadership is exiting, not confident in the direction it’s taking, so figured this would be a great time to make a change.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you describe your old bosses?* Last job- was first a coworker that was promoted to my boss. She was very kind, figuring out how to manage, but never lost sight of being compassionate and fighting for her team. Wonderful overall. Current job- nontech boss is very hands off since he doesn’t know the details of what I do, but gives good overall ideas. With tech boss, we work together constantly on data tasks or ideas for new tools to build. Very logical and unemotional at work, similar to me.

&nbsp;

After, I asked about what success looks like in the role and what were the biggest challenges facing his department.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP Marketing (final form)**


Here he was again! Back with more questions to grill me. I really liked the guy because he did his due diligence, and it was fun because the questions made my brain’s gears go overdrive.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you go about seeing if users ordering from more than one location is profitable?* I responded with a very convoluted explanation for A/B test, which he said was good, then asked how to do it without the ability to do A/B test using data we already have. Was able to eventually tell him something along the lines of a time series analysis involving control groups.

&nbsp;

•	*Walk me through how you'll implement A/B test.* Told him the basics, but that I haven’t done it in practice. Couldn’t answer his question about how long it should run for so I told him straight up, and he was okay with it.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you go about determining the optimal number of recommendations to show on the app for each geographical type?* Basic group-bys by geo and success rate for each number of recommendations shown.

&nbsp;

•	*What is logistic regression?* At this point I had just finished one of Andrew Ng’s deep learning course, where you code a logistic regression from scratch, so I did a little showboating here with how much I knew =D

&nbsp;

•	*Take me through the process of how you got into machine learning.* I told him basically what I’ve described here- that I felt useless after my master’s, needed to not be left behind in the machine learning revolution, went crazy from day one and here I am.

&nbsp;

I asked him:


•	What are the projects I'll work on in the first month?


•	You worked at other huge and established companies, so why here and what makes you come back everyday?


And! I give you the absolute best question to ask:


•	“You’ve had the most opportunity to get to know me and my skillset. I’d like to know if you had any reservations about my qualifications as a candidate so we can discuss and take care of any concerns.”


Boom! And just like that, I knew how impressed he was and that the only reservation was my short experience, but that I more than made up for it with my passion and drive. He almost didn’t want to say my lack of experience was a concern and looked very hesitant, I guess in fear of having me being like “peace!”


And that was that!


&nbsp;


**Step 9: Wait forever and get paranoid**


Title says it all. It’s hard to wait and wait especially when you felt like you did really well, and especially when the interviewing process took 3 weeks but the decision process takes another 3 weeks. My advice is simply keep applying to other places, don’t take your foot off the pedal, and continue learning/building things. I managed to finish another 2 courses from the time of the first interview to the offer, and even built my own small personal website. Don’t let up!


&nbsp;


**Step 10: Negotiate**


I’ll leave it to you to gather more advice on negotiating and how to go about it, but my general advice is to always negotiate. Whether the market value is higher than the offer (I’m not a fan of this explanation but I’ve never had to use it), or you suddenly feel that the responsibilities are worth more or, as in my case, you realize they don’t offer benefits you thought would be offered, then NEGOTIATE. It can be by phone or email, just do it. It’s uncomfortable, you’ll question your decision every second of the day for what seems like forever, you think they’ll rescind the offer and get someone cheaper. Just relax. It’s business. It’s part of showing your skills by not leaving money on the table. With a role as specialized as this where there is a lot of demand, you have the upper hand if you’ve already proved yourself. I got a nice bump at my current job and at the new data science job by asking for more. I’ll leave you this fantastic link that helped with a changing mindset:


http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

And that’s a wrap! A quick summary of the most important lessons I learned in this journey:


-	You don’t have to get an expensive Data Science degree or go to an expensive bootcamp. Everything is literally available for free somewhere online, and more structured resources are available at very low cost (Udemy and their $10 specials!)


-	Glassdoor is the most important app in this process. Download it, keep a fresh copy of your resume on your phone, and send out apps during your commute, at the laundromat, while in bed on a lazy Saturday, etc. It’s almost effortless


-	Absorb everything you can. A lot of it won’t stick, but a lot of it will.


-	Learning demands consistency. 10 hours of study spread across 2 weeks is much better than 10 hours you did that one weekend 2 weeks ago.


-	USE what you learn somehow- if you picked up python, google how to scrape the web, or how to automate sending files via email, or how to connect to a certain database. Make a project out of it, even a mini-project that you can speak about later. Google will show you the way! Optimizing processes is sexy and it was the most frequently asked question in this job search. 


-	In case you couldn’t tell, google and stackoverflow were lifesavers


-	Talk is cheap. A lot of people I know talk about taking classes and how excited they are. A year later they’re in the same place. Learn it, use it, and continue learning. Spend less time talking about how you’re gonna do something and work towards getting it done.


-	You’ll stumble through a lot of material- and that’s okay. Not everything is connected in the beginning, and a lot of it will feel like wasted effort. Keep going! You’ll reach the “aha!” moment when everything clicks and you “get it”. It might take a year and a half, but think about what would have happened if you started a year and a half ago?


-	Adding to the last point, it’s hard to know where to start and where to go. I’ll summarize a cheap quick start guide for data science below if you’re lost!


-	Get ready to make sacrifices. On average it was 3-4 hours daily, everyday, before or after work, and sometimes 6 hours on each of the weekend days. And this isn’t counting the coding I did during work to make things more efficient, which is at least another 3-4 hours per workday. 


-	I did take about 6-8 weeks off in total throughout the whole process though. You’ll burn out sometimes, and that’s okay! If you’re as driven and passionate as I was, you’ll come back to it weeks later, maybe even a month.


-	Lastly, reddit is a place of vast knowledge of the field. Use it, go to r/learnprogramming or r/datascience or r/jobs or r/personalfinance. There will be questions and topics covering a lot of what I covered here.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Quick start guide for data science:**


(in no particular order)


-	Introduction to Computer Science with Python from Edx.org


-	Either:


o	Andrew Ng’s Machine learning via coursera (not in python, but teaches you to know the matrix manipulation fundamentals)


o	Statistical Learning via Stanford Lagunita (more theory than programming understanding, but covers similar concepts, and introduces R which is also a good tool)


-	Python Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp via Udemy
Again, this is just to get started. Google and stackoverflow will take you to the next level and other courses will fill the knowledge gaps.

"Sorry, but there's no denying it. The front page is filled with naive posts about data science, such as 

'Computer science or statistics?'
'Projects on resumes'
'Certificate programs'

Most of the topics seem to be started by people who don't even work in the industry. While there does seem to be occasional good responses, they are few and far between. The filters do not help because there is little good discussion when filtering out career posts etc. 

Compare this to a subreddit like /r/machinelearning which has interesting articles and discussion and very little on careers.

EDIT: Also /r/dscareerquestions/ exists. Perhaps we could push career oriented discussion more towards that subreddit, especially specific questions like resume critiques etc.

"I've decided to make this small post to help people navigate this big world of data science, feel free to ask any follow up questions, and please do not PM me, any questions you have, ask them here, for everyone to see.

My background: I did a Phd and Masters in Data Science/ML, ML summer school, ML researcher at UCLA and Data Scientist at NASA. Currently do Data Science as a consulting gig, with a company.

**Architectures**

- Learn how to use Hadoop/Spark. But for the love of God, don't spend 3 months configuring your own Hadoop cluster. Is fun (I've done it), but is just not worth it. Familiarize yourself with plug and play systems like ElasticMapReduce (Amazon), HDInsight (Microsoft Azure), Cloudera or Hortonworks. They have all the tools you might need afterwards (NIFI, Storm, etc). 

- Learn how to setup and administer at least one SQL database and a non-SQL type. In a good company you will have a data engineer that will do that for you, but is always nice to know what the hell is happening.

- Don't try to understand and be fluent in every single tool available, learn the tools when you need to use them. I can't tell you how much time I've lost learning tools that I never used.

**Languages**

- DS is not art, you do not need beautiful languages like Haskell or be fluent in Design Patterns. DS is ugly hacking most of the time.

- As a followup learn Python or R, both are languages where hacking is rather easy and straightforward and have plenty of ways to interact with popular Big Data paradigms.

**Background**

- Learn math, really, you won't become a Data Scientist just because you know SQL and a bit of Python. Many times, the problem needs a not so obvious tool, and just using a demo algorithm from sklearn won't solve the problem.

- Before using an algorithm, be sure which function it is optimizing. You wouldn't use linear regression for classification, right? Why? Because both have different objective functions, and are optimizing different stuff.

- Really, really, don't just plug and play algorithms. We are not there yet.

- Start with simple models, and if they don't work move to more complex things. Data Science is not research, we are not competing to have the best accuracy, many times, the client doesn't give a shit about accuracy, just that their problem is solved. Honestly, unless you are Google or Facebook, your problems can be probably solved without using DeepLearning.

- On that note, don't jump steps. Don't start trying to do DeepLearning if you don't know other algorithms like SVMs or Logistic Regression. You would be amazed how many clients tell me they want to use Deep Learning and have like 500Kb of data.",Some advice for young and aspiring Data Scientists,6q1y7b,top,79.0,320.0,320.0,0.0

"Hi,

I put a post up a week or so ago about how I hire some junior data scientists - I was actually struggling because I usually hire more senior positions. 
&nbsp;

I got some *great* feedback - and thank you to everyone who commented. At the time though, I put up a comment saying that I felt that this subreddit, and others like the ML one, while great at covering SOME of the area's in data science, left gaps in other area's that really matter in real world scenarios.  I said I would write something about it.
&nbsp;


I wrote an obscenely long post about it, and then it didn't post properly (operator error). So, rather than re-type that essay, I thought I would do something at a higher level and then answer questions.
&nbsp;


Lets set some context first.
I work in private industry - a big(ish) UK financial services company. I do a mix of internal R&D type work - stuff our own teams ask for - and stuff that clients ask for. So - everything that follows is in that context - it is a bit different if your working for a start up company. It is very different if your working in acedemia. It's very different if your working for government agencies. Keep that in mind.
&nbsp;


I think this forum is awesome - I lurk every day. However, there is stuff that makes up the majority of my life and my guys life that doesn't get discussed here which - as there are so many people posting about moving into this world, and looking for jobs in this world - I think is an issue.
&nbsp;


Here are some things which I think need to be discussed here more. Also - if you can show me this stuff on a CV or in an interview, it will jump you straight to the top of the pile. 
&nbsp;



**1) You are ridiculously expensive - show me how you will add value.**
There is a team in every private company that all other departments fear and dread. They are called ""Finance"" and they are the bane of every managers life. They apply basic mathematics in bizarre ways, and they will constantly demand that managers either spend more or less money than they are. The managers will NEVER win.
&nbsp;



When it comes to head count it boils down to profit margin. Lets say I am recruiting for a senior data scientist and will pay then $100,000 ( really - thats a bit on the low side, but it makes a simple calculation). Lets say my company runs at a 20% profit margin. In the world of Finance, this means that that person needs to add $500,000 of value- not $100,000 -  before they break even. You may think this is crazy - but that is because you are a mere mortal and do not know Finance Maths. You don't have to agree with it - you just have to live with it.
&nbsp;



What does that mean for you the data guy? You need to **Get Stuff Done**. You probably aren't going to be getting your own sales leads and doing your own deals - but you need to add value. And that really means ***BEING PRAGMATIC***
&nbsp;



Some work needs to be *absolutely* perfect. These are the places where you spend the extra week tweaking your model for that last .1% of accuracy. It's where you are expected to go read papers to find a new clustering algorithm that will reduce the over-fit by .5% and you get a month to try it and deal with it.
&nbsp;



But - a lot of stuff doesn't need perfection. If you need to join two sets of data as a one off task, then it doesn't matter if you use SAS, a lump of PERL, bookmarks in TextPad, Excel, Python. No one cares - you just need to get it done. If you need to know whether two elements of data correlate, then often a basic regression is ""good enough"", and will save you a couple of hours.
&nbsp;



*What does this mean?*
You'll know which hat you need to wear - but when you're wearing your ""just get it done"" hat - which will be more often than your ""Get it perfect"" hat - you need to a toolbag full of quick work arounds and practical methods. If something takes 100 lines of SAS, 10 lines of Python or 2 lines of Perl... don't go the SAS route. If you need to eyeball and juggle 10,000 records then you could drop it out as a set of tables with R, or you could do it in Excel. I know it's not cool - but finance don't care - so your manager doesn't - so you don't. Get good at this stuff. Be pragmatic. Know when to have a ""Good enough"" mentality. And show it.....
&nbsp;



**2) Learn to deal with junk**
Real world data is, usually, rubbish. You need to be *REALLY* good at dealing with rubbish.
Examples - I have about 2 petabytes of data coming from about 8,000 sources. The absolute best raw data set has a 2% error rate. The worst has a 75% error rate. Those figures are better than a lot of other groups are dealing with. You don't get to complain or get someone else to clean it up - you need to be good at adapting to it. REALLY REALLY REALLY good.
&nbsp;


That data comes in to me in perhaps 1500 schemas and formats. No provider - ever - sticks to a schema. EVER. *EVER!* So, I need to be able to join data that arrived in EBSDIC to stuff that turns up in weirdly compressed AVRO. (tip here - learn to love CSV - it's a perfect intermediate - as is an SQLite table). Looking across my data sets, I can see a minimum of 21 different data structures for Date:Time. What ever your going to do, your going to use dates and times. So - thats something you need to be slick with. Remember Point 1) - this is ""Get It Done"" stuff. 
&nbsp;


Also - a lot of data science is speculative - your going to have 10 idea's for every 1 actual piece of solid work you do. For those idea's, you're usually going to need to crash a data sample together, give it an eyeballing, patch it up a bit, do some basic work and see if it's practical. That means 9 out of 10 of those tasks you do will be disposable - so just Get It Done.
&nbsp;


All of this is probably best described as ""Data Monkeying"" - your not doing science - your monkeying with data. Realistically over the course of a year, you will probably spend 50% of your time doing Data Monkey work rather than real Data Science. 
&nbsp;


*What does that mean?*
When i recruit a data scientist, they absolutely, completely and totally MUST be damn good data monkeys. I'm counting on you being able to do the data monkeying in 50% of your day, not 90% of your day, so that the other 50% of your day you can do the ""Data Science"" bit and actually add value - cos the Finance Team are watching...
&nbsp;


It's not cool, you don't get a conference speech out of it, and it doesn't get you a bonus, but unless you are dealing with a single source of data, a good deal of your life is going to be spent dealing with this mess. You need to 1) get good at it and 2) not take too long dealing with it.
&nbsp;


If I had god like powers over this Sub I would make it so that 50% or more of the posts are people trading tips, cookbooks, idea's and lots of practice data sets so they are getting good at data monkeying, rather than Data Science. Definitely less cool - but will make the biggest impact to your working lives.
&nbsp;


Some examples of data monkeying: Flicking between data structures and schemas. Recasting data. parsing data. Changing time series - compressing and interpolation of time events -Spliting data. Joining data. Dealing with common types of tricky data - like names, address structures, dates, time series. blah blah blah.
&nbsp;


Fastest way to get your CV to the top of the pile - make sure that I can see your data monkeying as well as your data science skills.
&nbsp;


**3) Learn to tell a story and not be scary.**
Your going to work with all sorts of people - Sales, IT, Operations and lots of managers. And you will intimidate EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. Whether you are or not actually scary, when you walk into a room, they will automatically assume that you are the brightest person in that room and that your going to baffle them. 
&nbsp;


Some people - a minority - will try and get close to you and learn from you. The vast majority will react to their intimidation by either not listening to you at all ( many managers ) or feeling annoyed by you ( most sales people). It's not anyone's fault - it's just human nature. If you break out the big words, the jargon, the acronyms and present them with a 19 page excel spreadsheet you do nothing but reinforce those pre-conceptions. Downside for you is that it's harder to rapidly climb the career ladder. Downside for your boss is that it's harder for you to show 5x or 20x your salary as value - which means more discussions with Finance ( shudder)
&nbsp;



*Two easy fixes and one sneaky fix:*
**Fix 1** - Learn to tell a story. Seriously - when you tell people about your work give it a beginning, a middle and an end. ""I was asked X, I did A, B, C and D, it looks like the answer is Y"". You might not need to do this for people for people who read this sub, but this is humanising you. Another thing - put it in context ... I.e. ""A client has X as a problem... I did A, B, C and D. It looks like the answer is Y because it helps the client due to....blah blah blah..""
&nbsp;




**fix 2** - present in the right way for the audience.
Some people can deal with lots of data. Some people insist on it. Some people are intimiated by it. Some people genuinely see it as you trying to hide behind a snow of nonsense.  For example - if your doing something for a finance group, or a bunch of actuaries - you NEED the 19 page spreadsheet. And you'd better be damn sure every single cell is correct. If you were presenting to a senior sales manager, then you want a few pages of Powerpoint with big diagrams and a few bullets per page maximum. Thats not because the sales guy is less clever - it's just what they need to consume information. 
&nbsp;



You don't need to be a graphic designer - but you do need an acceptable grasp of displaying data. Reading FlowingData. Read blogs. Practice. Learn to make an acceptable spreadsheet. Learn to make an acceptable PowerPoint. Play with MathPlotLib/SAS-Graph/Plotly..... Again - you don't need to be amazing - you don't need to be a master data visualisation expert - ""good enough"" - but that still needs practice.
&nbsp;



**Sneaky fix:** Remember how you intimidate people because they think your a genius? Ask them a question about something they know - ""What do you think the client will do with this"" or ""How will HR use this data to plan the company party?"". Give them a set of options for something even if you make them up  Doesn't matter what it is - just ask one so they can contribute. Practice doing it subtly.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;


I think I'm going to run out of words soon - more in the next comment.

"My husband is a data scientist at Facebook and hates it. The data is interesting and he's learning a lot of great stuff, but the company goes against his personal core values (think: everything that's been in the news lately regarding Russian interference and privacy). I'm curious if there are some other industries that need data scientists that are generally using the data for ""good"". The only thing I can think of is the healthcare industry, but in job descriptions they really seem to want people who have a background in bioinformatics. 

Are there any organizations or companies that use data to help people? He doesn't want to go work at Amazon, or Google, etc. My husband has about 6 years of experience, has a BS in economics, and loves SQL so much he probably dreams in it. He has taken on a lot of data engineering work as well and is very interested in companies/ organizations where the data infrastructure is fairly new and needs some love, since he's wrangled with this a lot in the past and enjoys it. Any advice about a new direction for his career would be greatly appreciated by both of us. Thanks!

Data engineering is a very important field, but it is new, often under-appreciated, and rarely discussed relative to its close cousin Data Science. I still remembered the first time I was trying to learn Luigi, an open-sourced project from Spotify for ETL, and I struggled a lot to find accessible materials.

"Hey /r/datascience!

A few weeks ago I submitted a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7xeoit/i_have_my_first_interview_lined_up_for_a_data/) regarding an interview I landed, and received a lot of helpful feedback from you all.

After 3 interviews and hours of learning SQL, data visualization, and Python everyday after work for a few weeks, I'm so excited to say I landed the job! It's entry level, but they're matching my currently salary as an engineer (which is still entry level, but hey can't complain). Not only that, they have a great tuition reimbursement plan so I can get my masters in CS or math.

I've been wanting to start a career in data science/analysis for a while now, and I'm just really excited that I finally got an opportunity so I wanted to share it with you guys. 

Thanks! ",Just accepted an offer for my first Data Analyst position!!,82bto3,top,19.0,199.0,199.0,0.0
"A little bit of background... About 7 months ago I decided I needed a career change due to a number of reasons.  Working as a Mechanical Engineer was not fulfilling anymore and I started to hear more about Data Science and Machine Learning.  I've always had a passion for performing data analyses but never really considered it more than a responsibility of my various positions.  After looking more into the field of Data Science, I was immediately hooked and wanted to learn everything I could in this field.  

I started with a subscription to Datacamp.com and worked my way through the Data Scientist Track with R path.  In addition, I took some courses on Coursera (Machine Learning with Andrew Ng) and EdX (Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science).  I exposed myself to some Kaggle competitions and went to a few local Data Science meetups.  These were great opportunities to network and speak with other Data Scientists/Analysts to see what they were working on and brush up on skills that would look great on my resume.  Ultimately, I focused on Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn), R, and SQL.  The above courses are great for getting your toes wet and introducing you to the basics.  Also, keep looking at r/datascience and reading of others success stories, they have some great roadmaps!

With my skill-set quickly growing, I began applying to jobs about 3 months ago.  Anyone who's been through the application process before will know that this is a painstakingly slow process so whatever you do, don't give up and keep applying!  I applied anywhere and everywhere that had a position that sounded interesting.  Most importantly, I was applying for positions I thought I could eventually do, not just the ones that I could do now.  All the while, still working on my skills through any free courses I could find.

Up until about 3 weeks ago, I was getting very few responses to my applications with even less interviews.  Although discouraging, I didn't give up.  I have to throw a big thanks to my friends, and most particularly my roommates for keeping me going through this process.  The single biggest change through this process occurred after my roommate suggested I update my resume.  Not just the content, but the format and look too.  I reluctantly took this advice and spent a few hours crafting multiple revisions until I got something that I was happy with the result.

After updating my resume and applying to a few new jobs, my responses skyrocketed, I couldn't believe it (I fully intend to create a time series of this whole process BTW).  I went from next to no interviews to multiple phone calls in a single day and multiple in-person interviews in a week.  Full disclosure, it takes more than a pretty resume to extend the interview process so obviously it helps to understand the content.  

I quickly managed to talk my way into a few interviews and I now landed my first job offer with another two interviews finishing up shortly!  My biggest problem now is deciding what to do if I receive multiple offers but that is definitely a good problem to have.  I would have never thought I would be in this situation but it helps to know that it can happen to anyone so don't give up chasing your passions!

I hope my story can serve as a little bit of inspiration to anyone else out there looking to make a career change, it's never too late!

Background on me:  I'm an engineer who made a feeble jump to 'citizen data science' in 2017.  sum total of my education are the courses at fast.ai, by /u/jeremyhoward .  I'm a programmer, not a math PhD (which is why the fast.ai courses appealed to me).  I also have a background in developing IT curriculum, which is why I am posting this. 

And, I'm *quite sure* that the 'how do you get started in Data Science' question has too many answers out there, and none of them are great.   I'll hack a quote together, stolen from [Paul Lockhart](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf) and reworded to be relevant to this problem (**bold** are my edits):

> fact, if I had to design a mechanism for the express purpose of destroying a **person's** natural

&nbsp;

**Here's are the problems I see with the current state:**

* Too many (very convincing) answers out there to the 'how to get started' question. (blog posts, moocs, reddit threads, etc).
* The answers are typically incomplete due to the *individual* biases of those answering.
* The answers, (and those recommending them after the fact) begin to become stale vs. state-of-the-art the *moment* they are posted.  (e.g. are we seriously still recommending the 2011 Ng course?)
* Most of the learning path recommendations are too frontloaded w formal math/stats heavy for the people typically asking it. Someone who is considering a bona fide Data Science education will *not* need to ask 'how do I get started in Data Science'.  They need help finding a degree program.  Most people asking this question *really* want to become citizen data scientists (bu they don't know it yet).

&nbsp;

**Here is what I envision:**

* A canonical, open source, community driven project maintained in GitHub.
* The content is designed around a **very specific** framework that enforces some core concepts:
    * **problem based:**  Imagine a 'tech tree' of canonical ML/DL problems that represent the center of gravity of *high value* ML/DL methods and techniques.  Like [this](http://www.saedsayad.com/data_mining_map.htm), with one problem per domain, and maybe only 20-30 problems total in the tech tree at any given time.
    * **continuously updated:** Continuous improvements are submitted by the community, and curated by a small committee of qualified maintainers, who are curating around a well-define set of criteria.  New problems and accompanying lessons are submitted in a standard format (see below) via pull request 
    * **progressive**: crawl, walk run.  Learning paths always start with the 'hello world' ML examples, and have a few progressive learning paths defined that define 2-3 different journeys through that tech tree, where each subsequent problem builds on principles learned in those before it.  Problems increase in difficulty/complexity as the learner progresses through the chosen learning path.
    * **practical**: learners are writing code and solving problems as a first principle, with real data from the first step, and every subsequent step.  Humans learn by playing the whole game.  (Read David Perkins, [Making Learning Whole](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/09/01/education-bat-seven-principles-educators))
    * **inclusive:**  This is not intended to be a replacement or comparable to a formal Data Science degree program.  The truth is, a formal DS education is *simply not* a prerequisite to using computers and code to answer questions about data, and to understanding how those answers are derived.
    * **emphasizes math:**  The goal isn't to 'cirucumvent' a formal math education, it's to sprinkle it in judiciously along the way, instead of making it a prerequisite.  e.g. hello world problems will branch off to teach the actual math behind linear regression.  When SGD s introduced, we will branch off to teach the actual math behind SGD.  Every problem should be accompanied by a new practical math component that is given nearly as much emphasis as the problem solving/coding.
    * **standardized:**  The learning content for a 'problem' has a well defined and consistent standard:  Problem statement, sample data, solution criteria, list of principles introduced, a math concept, etc.  The format of problem/lesson submissions is a Jupyter notebook with a step-by-step walkthrough of the problem and solution.  Bonus points for embedding a YT video walkthrough in the notebooks.

Thoughts?  Feedback?  Anybody want to help?  I'm qualified to organize and drive this initiative, but I'm not qualified to curate or define the specific problems in the tech tree.

"This huge story is rocking the NBA right now: [The Curious Case of Bryan Colangelo and the Secret Twitter Account](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/29/17406750/bryan-colangelo-philadelphia-76ers-twitter-joel-embiid-anonymous-markelle-fultz?utm_campaign=theringer&utm_content=chorus&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter).

The President of Basketball Operations of the 76er's is Bryan Colangelo and he has been using burner accounts to spar with the media. The article is fascinating and deserves a read, but here's the relevant part:

>**The Source**  
>  
>Our source, whose identity is still unknown, contacted me via anonymous “egg” accounts on both Instagram and Twitter, claiming that they had a scoop. The source explained that they worked in artificial intelligence and, after noticing a “bunch of weird tweets” directed at Sixers writers, used an open\-source data analysis tool to link five accounts through commonalities including similarities in who the accounts followed and linguistic quirks.  
>  
>“They all have a pattern of likes, follows, and tweets which are EXTRAORDINARILY similar,” the source wrote in a direct message on Twitter. For example, the source explained, all five follow accounts tied to Sixers players, members of the Philly front office, and beat reporters who cover the team; Toronto Raptors writers; Canadian high school basketball; and University of Chicago basketball. They discuss the same topics, use strikingly similar phrasing, and, at times, have tweeted out identical media images. Some of those shared attributes were odd, such as a distaste for beards and “unknown sources.” According to the source’s findings, the three newest accounts followed 75 accounts in common—roughly half of their total respective follows—with another 52 accounts followed by two of the three. \(*The Ringer* was unable to verify those numbers, but they seem to track with our analysis.\)

I thought it was interesting \(and honestly hilarious after reading some tweets; r/nba is having a field day\) and was worth a discussion here. I would be over the moon if the data science vigilante open sourced his work. Maybe he or she is reading this right now!

I've gone from an era where we had to transfer large datasets in CSV through FTP and running our models in a remote SAS server to scalable machine learning in the cloud, but the one thing that hasn't changed is the need to translate complex business problems into data problems and then translating them back into useful insights to convince the suits to make changes.

I see data scientists fresh out of school who want nothing to do with exploratory data analysis, they want to get to ""building models"". To them, the article has an answer that's phrased much better than I could have.

> These days a great deal of machine learning and deep learning is being automated, as we learned when we dedicated an episode to automated machine learning, and heard from Randal Olson, lead data scientist at Life Epigenetics. One result of this rapid change is that the vast majority of my guests tell us that the key skills for data scientists are not the abilities to build and use deep-learning infrastructures. Instead they are the abilities to learn on the fly and to communicate well in order to answer business questions, explaining complex results to nontechnical stakeholders. Aspiring data scientists, then, should focus less on techniques than on questions.

"Having a hard time here. New boss around, not technical at all, but more on the ""consulting side"". Some time ago we developed a small solution to forecast/estimate trends in commodity prices. Not exactly the same as stock market, but very close; the same mathematical properties of the signals. The idea was to have a very approximate and long term view of the trends and the expected average level of prices in +12, +24 months... That was delivered, and everybody happy. 

Now, New Boss sold the idea that we (I!) can predict spot price at a certain date. 

I explained her that it is not possible to do that (at the level of accuracy required), but she insisted and now she expects to see results of everything, from ARIMA or persistence to neural networks. She thinks I am lying or being not proactive. I ran some tests in different technologies to show her that it is not possible to get what she wants, but now the perspective shifted, and now New Boss thinks that the problem is that I am not fine tuning things properly, or working hard enough. 

My mistake: I once said ""sure, I can try and you will see"", but now things are getting worse. She even suggested hiring a new guy just to work on this ""project"". 

I shared with her papers, blog posts, articles, and of course explained her how this works, but in the end, she always end with ""but computers are so powerful! we must be able!""

Two years ago, I shared my experience on doing data science in the industry. The writing was originally meant to be a private reflection for myself to celebrate my two year twitterversary at Twitter, but I instead published it on Medium because I believe it could be very useful for many aspiring data scientists.

Fast forward to 2017, I have been working at Airbnb for a little bit less than two years and have recently become a senior data scientist — an industry title used to signal that someone has acquired enough technical skills to lead projects. As I reflect on my journey so far and imagine what’s next to come, I once again wrote down a few lessons that I wish I had known in the early days of my career.

If the intended audience of my previous post was for aspiring data scientists and people who are completely new to the field, then this article is for people who are already in the field but are just starting out.

So, there was no resource that had information like, ""This one is run by a crazy person"" or ""this one is taught by charlatans."" I would have loved to have found a resource like that, but I couldn't find one anywhere.

"**Why?**
 
Data is the closest thing we have to a real world application of truth, and the world is a better place when decisions are made with care. 

Now that you know why you should become a data scientist, here is a simple guide to becoming one. 

**Prerequisites:**

**Math**: You can honestly get really far with little math. That being said, there are far too many people who don't understand the math and end up using analysis techniques with little forethought into why they should be using that model. I will say this much: The more math, the better off you are. It is a beautiful field and directly relevant to you if you want to make the most of your foray into data science. 

Beginner: High school algebra, maybe some calculus 1, high school statistics

Intermediate: College stats, Calc 1,2,3, Probability Theory, linear algebra, Statistical Inference

Advanced: Upper undergrad / Grad level statistical inference, bayesian inference, harder probability theory, linear optimization, convex optimization, real analysis, calculus of variations. Math is the limiting factor, remove those obstacles. Learn all the advanced math you can muster.

Reccs: khanacademy if you've never seen the content. MIT OCW has really great self paced math courses for calc 1-3, linear algebra and much more. Eventually you will want to learn the art of grinding through math textbooks while doing problems. **The only way to learn math is by doing math. Practice, practice, practice.**

If you want to be a true OG, here is Michael I. Jordan's reading list for prospective grad students in ML:

**Programming**

Pick up a language and stick with it for now. It is far easier to pick up a second language once you are very good at one than it is to slowly work through being mediocre at a bunch of languages. 

People live and die by their language of choice for some reason. Generally, my thoughts on this are the following:

R is fantastic. R is great for data analysis, and if you use the tidyverse, R is great for everything else too. R is an **organically grown** language that is not always lexically consistent, so it can be a bit quirky. Due to the community of statistics researchers that use R, generally you will find the most bleeding edge packages on R. R will make you think like a statistician.

Python is great for taking your data a bit farther. It has packages which provide most of the functionality you would need from R. Python is a great choice because it has many more varied packages and capabilities related to software development. Python is a broad, general purpose language that is beautifully **designed** and consistent. This will make you think more like a programmer.

Over a career, it is wise to know as many tools well as you can. Since you will spend a good amount of time writing code, you should strive to learn both at some point. 

Alrighty, now onto the core stuff. 

**How to:**

**1. Get Data**

This can be done by scraping, downloading a data set, building a data set, making a survey, whatever. There is a lot of data floating around and there are plenty of resources for learning how to scrape. Since data is usually stored in data bases in the real world, it is wise to learn a bit about data bases. Learn some SQL. Since we live in the age of big data, it would also be wise to learn non-relational database query languages like nosql and postgresql

Some good spots for data: /r/datasets, kaggle, data.gov

**2. Clean it**

Remember: garbage in, garbage out. The quality of the data is the foundation of all your work from here on out. Check out a book or a course that will take you from these early stages into actually playing with the data. For python, [Harvard CS109](https://github.com/cs109/content) does this. It also have video lectures. For R, Hadley Wickham (Chief Scientist at RStudio) has a bunch of amazing books out. Check out [R for Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1511408512&sr=8-1&keywords=r+for+data+science) . It wouldn't hurt to eventually read a book on data cleaning and data interpolation.

**3. Take some time to familiarize yourself with your data**

What kind of variables are there? Quantitative (numbers)? Categorical / Qualitative (Labels)? Text? Images?
 Geographical? The types of data present will determine what can be modeled. 

Its a good idea to look at the data in list form and plot it out using R or python or excel or whatever. If using other types of data (eg images, geographical), then find the best ways to visualize the data. Now would be a good time to learn about knitr and rmarkdown if using R and jupyter notebooks if using python. 

This is the time to do some *descriptive statistics.* Look at the way the data flows on the plots. What relationships do you think are there? Are there any outliers? Plot, plot, plot, and plot some more. Make the plots look good. Check out ggplot2 in R or matplotlib / seaborn in python. 

Learn to dissect your data. Check out feature engineering. Learn to combine data sets to expand what can be done.

If you want to be a true OG, learn some graphic design principles. Learn to use blank space and color. There is nothing more influential than a beautiful graph.

A book on seaborn / matplotlib if using python. 

**4. Figure out the questions you want to ask**

This is perhaps the hardest part. The questions you ask will determine what you find in the data. When thinking about questions, ponder proactively about what techniques you would use to answer them. This is where a broad set of modeling tools comes handy. That will be gone over in the next section.

**5. Analysis**

The most satisfying part in my opinion. When you wrote out your questions, hopefully you have some idea of what techniques you would use. That said, there are a lot of techniques to choose from and each technique has its own special niches. You will learn to select models properly from seeing a lot of data and practicing. Like everything else, practice, practice, practice. Try many models, run them on test sets using cross validation and see what works best. Learn about bias-variance trade-off. 

Generally statistical analysis is broken into 2 parts: 

In descriptive statistics we want to describe the patterns and structure of the data. If you did part 3 well, this will be partially taken care of. You can expand on this as the analysis comes along. 

In inferential statistics we want to predict from the data. This is what we are at now. 

Broadly speaking, this is the content that seems to be spread around the most. I will post some reccs to different courses / books that you will see floating around this subreddit (because they are great).

**Make sure you learn and understand cross validation extremely well.**

**Make sure to understand the assumptions behind each modeling technique you use. There is no one size fits all technique.** 

Since this is such a broad topic, go learn data analysis from books and courses. Learn models, figure out why you would want to use them, and then apply them. 

Once you have completed your modeling, make sure to create a visualization. If others will be seeing it, learn to explain things in simple terms as if non experts will see it. When you are being paid to be a data scientist, it is not about how intelligent you come across, it is about results and understanding for everyone.

**6. The Great Beyond**

After step 5, you are essentially a (good) data analyst. What will differentiate you now will be the extras. Heres some other stuff that you should probably look into: 

* Databases: SQL / Nosql / any query language really. 

* Data Engineering: Create pipelines and automate a lot of the legwork to make raw data usable. 

* Shell: Linux is cool, and bash scripting is useful

* Hadoop, Mapreduce, Spark, AWS, etc: Big Data

* Deep Learning : See what the hype is all about

* Time series analysis: Given the ubiquity of time series data, a book on TSA can't hurt

* Computer Science: Learn CS rigorously. Check out Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, CLRS Algorithms, Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming, and more. If you learn the concepts underlying the technologies you see, you won't be outdated nearly as easily. Tools may change, but the concepts and math stay the same. 

* Learn to love practicing. This list is daunting, but it is completely achievable one small step at a time. Setting aside time to learn and practice daily will get you farther than you could ever imagine. 



**Guide to Learning**

Like all other things in life, there are exciting things and less exciting things. What you find exciting is unique to you, but for the sake of this guide I will give how I would learn the content (assuming you know basic maths and programming): 

* Learn some data analysis. If using python, think stats is nice. If using R, R for Data Science is nice
* Learn how to clean and dissect data. If you read one of the books in the bullet above, you will have learned this.
* Now learn some visualization. Make it pretty with a book on ggplot or seaborn/matplotlib
* Now learn some better tools for analysis: Read and work through Intro to Statistical Learning or Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course. Ideally you would do both. 
* Learn database query languages. You will come across databases, so its best to be a wizard with them. 
* Learn hadoop / map reduce / spark for big data
* Learn the theory on a deeper level. [Probability Theory](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110) is great, Statistical Inference is great, Bayesian Inference and multilevel modeling is great. 
* Never stop learning

"Speaking as someone with a PhD in a quantitative field who'd like to become a data scientist (at least, I think I'd like to do that), it has been a challenge to figure out what the data science career is all about and especially how to get into it. I think I'm a pretty smart, discerning person, but the things I've read and heard about this career are, as a whole, so confusing and so contradictory it's hard to know what to think.

Several months ago, after doing some research, I thought this was a viable path for me and that I had a plan to get into the field. Today, I don't know whether any of the things I believed about this career months ago are true, whether it's realistic for me to get a data science position in the near future, or whether this is a career I would even want.

I thought I'd list paraphrased version of some of the confusing and often contradictory things I've read and heard about this career for your amusement. If anyone has thoughts, by all means please comment, although at this point I don't think I'll believe anything anyone says about this stuff without experiencing it firsthand.

* Data science is a viable career path for people without a strong technical background who are willing to take a couple online courses.

* It's very straightforward to get a data scientist position if you have an advanced degree in any quantitative field, especially if you can code.

* It's almost impossible to get a data scientist position right out of (grad) school. No matter what field your degree was in, you probably need to spend a couple years working as a data analyst or BI person to get some domain expertise.

* Data science is a field with a serious talent shortage; companies are desperate for anyone who's at all qualified.

* The data science job market is flooded with applicants; any open job is going to get dozens if not hundreds of reasonably qualified applicants. It's really hard to get a job unless you seriously stand out. 

* The technical skills are the least important aspect. It's more important to work well with people and be a good communicator. You can easily learn the technical aspects on the job.

* A data scientist just needs to know more statistics than a programmer and more coding than a statistician.

* A data scientist needs to know all about optimization, numerical analysis, algorithms and data structures, and lots of advanced machine learning and statistics.

* The only things you really have to know are the fundamentals: be able to write some code in Python and R and know about confidence intervals and linear regression.

* In order to appeal to employers, it's crucial to have experience with the *exact technologies* the employer uses. If they use Hadoop, you must know Hadoop. Etc.

* There's no way to be a data scientist without knowing some pretty advanced math.

* Math isn't really relevant for data science in practice, and some of the most successful data scientists I know don't even know calculus.

* Data scientists spend their time working on intellectually challenging problems that are just as interesting as those in academia.

* Data scientists spend most of their time on boring data munging issues, usually with an ultimate goal of selling more shoes or some other horrible marketing thing.

* The data science field is really hot and will surely continue to grow for many years to come.

* Data science has hit its peak; it will continue to be useful in its areas of legitimate application, but companies are realizing it was oversold and they will be cutting back.

* There is an amazing amount of value to be had in data science.

* Most data scientists contribute nothing worthwhile to their employers.

* You must have a portfolio of projects to show employers.

* I don't know any data scientists with a portfolio of projects; my coworkers and I think that's a waste of time.

Here's another discouraging thing: looking at job ads for data scientist positions, there is such a crazy variety of skills and experience desired for each position. While I know that ""Required skills"" aren't always really required, it's pretty bewildering when:

* one position says you must have NLP experience;

* one says you must have cybersecurity experience;

* one says you must have Javascript and web programming experience (?!);

* one says you must have experience in the health care industry;

* one says you must have retail marketing experience;

* one says you must have bioinformatics experience;

* one says you must have experience in the intelligence community;

* one says you must have Django experience (?!);

* one says you must have experience with the Microsoft products SSMS, SSAS, and SSRS;

* one says you must know SAS;

* one says you must have experience in financial analysis.

In the above list, when I listed specific technologies, it was because they seem somewhat outside the standard data science toolkit, as far as I know. But even when they mention ""mainstream"" technologies, they vary so much between the different positions, and there is such a massive list. Different ones want AWS, Spark, Hadoop, Hive, Pig, PostgreSQL, MySQL, D3, Tableau, MapReduce, Flink, Mahout, MongoDB, Cassandra, and many more.

Judging by the ads, there is probably hardly anyone in the world who is qualified for more than one of these positions... and yet they are all ""data scientist"" positions.

2. **Beginner questions about getting into Data Science may only be made to the ""beginner"" sticky submission.**  This can include those just starting out or those trying to change their career.  The sticky threads will be archived at some interval, which will be determined later.  An archival list will be kept for beginners to be directed towards.

3. **Additional moderators are required.** This is in order to facilitate quicker submission and user flair approval/rejection.

Furthermore, link and user flair categories will need to be updated to reflect these changes.  However, this may hold off until the new reddit site redesign is complete due to changes in how flair filtering works.

Hopefully I can leave university with a 2:1 in Maths & Statistics, for which I'll have to work for. 

I'm interested in programming, and statistics. But I wouldn't say I'm good at either. I couldn't create any algorithms and I'd have difficultly giving explanations of basic statistics concepts at the moment. I've done some R and Python, so I could be told what to do. But I couldn't implement anything fancy. 

I see a lot of things about reading papers, fancy algorithms, models, programming, advanced statistics and maths stuff.... but that's clearly not something that I'm going to be applying for. But maybe there are roles on the peripheries that I'm not aware of? I'm not sure. 

There's a lot of content for people who're very capable, but I rarely see much for people who're just standard / average or whatever. So I'm curious whether there's advice about what kind of things are out there for someone like that.

"Hi all, working through my first neural network side project. I'm trying to predict which P2P borrowers will default/charge off a loan. 

In the first iteration, I used only my own investment data to create a binary classification of those who paid back their loans (0) and those who defaulted (1). The problem lies in the ratio of available data: 99% of people paid, and 1% defaulted. So the NN has learned to predict that 100% of people will pay their loans and can still report 99% accuracy.

I found a much bigger data set (about 850k items vs. my original 4k) with the hope that throwing more data at the model might help. Unfortunately, the overall ratio is the same: 99% paid and 1% defaulted. This results in the same inaccurate prediction.

So experts, can you share any advice on how to approach this kind of problem? I was wondering if it's a logical approach to alter the ratio of the training set, i.e. use less of the data overall so that 1% becomes 25%. Alternatively, I am only using 2 features in the initial NN. Could adding more complexity with additional features improve the accuracy?

"Hey everyone thought I would post a little bit about my first year out of undergrad and first year as a data analyst. I previously posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6znbdo/data_analyst_one_month_in/) about a my background and a little bit about my job. 

In the past year, I have been promoted from analyst I to analyst II and have been accepted to GT analytics program, which my company has agreed to pay for 70% of tuition and 100% of other fees, while working full time.

I work for a natural gas company and continue to do marketing analytics. In my first year, I have gotten very very very familiar with SQL, and cleaning lots and lots of data (shout out tidyverse). I am lucky enough that my team is small and my work requires me to go from pulling the data, to cleaning the data, to ultimately building a model if necessary. 

There are certain things that I have learned through out my year as an analyst 

* Ask questions. Often if you don't know what is going on with the data someone else does. People tend to be helpful especially when you are starting out. 

* Assume the model you built is too good to be true if you are getting some amazing results. Often times there is some data leakage issue that you did not see immediately, but your skepticism will help you catch that. 

* Build things because there is a dollar amount associated with the knowledge created from your analysis. Nobody cares that you have a cool ML algorithm if it does not save or make the company any money. 

* Always have a simple baseline model to compare more complex models to. Losing easily interpreted coefficients should not be taking lightly. How much more accuracy is worth losing that occasional more actionable insight?

* Get comfortable with SQL, like really comfortable and be prepared to clean data and write views for other people... 

* Comment and version control your code. Bitbucket, github, vsts or whatever you use is your friend. 

* Create pipelines to help with reproducible work. Shout out [drake](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) and [airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/). 

Ask to help others on their projects and please please learn about the company, the business' needs, and goals before building some crazy model. Often times a simple approach is just as good as a black box ML model (not saying all the time).

"I don't know what subreddit is best for this post. Sorry if it's not this one.

So I'm a data analyst, not a data scientist. I just finished grad school (not data science) and I'm between jobs and about to move to a new city, so I've been taking the last few weeks to go through Datacamp's material fairly intensely (~4 hours a day) to upgrade my skills before I get my hopes and dreams crushed by the job market.

...


The **first** thing I noticed about Datacamp was that they did a lot of stuff *for* me. I'd open up an exercise and most of the code had been written already, with a couple of spaces with '____' where I should fill in the right answer. I thought this was really frustrating, because there was never any point in the process where they explained to me why we needed to perform whatever operation it was. I'm like 50 hours in, and I'm not sure I could do any of this without Datacamp's prompting. I think this is the worst part of the Datacamp curriculum. I feel that I'm paying Datacamp to teach me Python syntax and when to use it (not just how to use it), and I feel like I'm not learning either of those things.

**Second,** although Datacamp courses offer short video segments that putatively ""teach"" the course, the exercises were essentially big text boxes. Oftentimes the video and text would be somewhat out of sync, and sometimes it felt like entire sections had been omitted between text and video. This made watching the videos almost completely optional, and considering most of them are shorter than 5 min, there was never enough time to substantively introduce the material anyway.

**Third**, the exercises rarely feel practical. There are some nice real-world datasets used, but because of what I describe in my first paragraph, it's hard to actually interface with them. You're not really working with them yourself. Beyond that, it doesn't feel like Datacamp spends a lot of time trying to motivate the problem. Why do we need to take this approach, etc. There are often domain-specific considerations that influence how the problem may best be solved, and that stuff is completely omitted. This ends up meaning that these supposedly practical exercises end up anything but.

I had a really long paragraph here about how **I dislike their two-part statistics course**. TL;DR: I thought the treatment of linear regression was really shallow and incomplete (there's no mention of residuals at all, for example), and I thought leaving out multiple and logistic regression meant it didn't provide enough for students to actually learn how to work with data. I've never worked as a data scientist, but I understand that those two are important. They're already super useful as an analyst.

**That's not to say that Datacamp is terrible.** I really liked some of the data viz stuff they've got (Seaborn and Bokeh are awesome), and I think their first couple of intro to Python courses are helpful. I've heard great things about their R courses, as well. And Datacamp has got a great platform for what they're doing.

I'm certainly going to finish my month of Datacamp, but I don't think I'll be resubscribing. I know it's kind of a cheap shot, but I feel like I might subscribe to one of their competitor products in the hope that they can teach me more of the syntax and thought process behind this stuff. I'm disappointed to be paying somebody to teach me, only to have to Google what they're supposed to be teaching.",My Review: Unimpressed with Datacamp (for Python),8n4ui3,top,45.0,128.0,128.0,0.0

"I’ve noticed a bunch of posts here that are of the form “I’m a X major and want to be a data scientist, what do I do?” so I thought I would chime in and give my opinion.  I hire data scientists so I thought I would tell you what I look for when I’m hiring newbies.  Experienced people are another story. 

First, you need to be able to code.  And I’m more interested in hacking skills more than formal systems development. If you need a formal requirements document and 6 agile sprints to complete a data science engagement you are taking too long.  Besides, 50%-70% of your work will be taking the crappy data you are given and putting it in a form that can be analyzed. For that you’ll need PERL, Python, VB, etc.  After you have done it you probably don’t need to do it again in the exact same way.  So you need to hack that mother.  It would be awesome if you had minions to do the shit work for you but let’s face it, if you are just coming out of school you are the minion.  I knew people in grad school that got straight A’s but couldn’t program their way out of a paper bag.  I don’t want those people.  So convince me that you can write code. 

You need to understand data.  This seems to be under represented in “how to be a data scientist” posts but it is very important.  But  you need to have a good feel for data representation and modeling.  Sooner or later you will need to impose structure on data or the data that is given to you will be highly structured.  Being able to put your data in the correct form can make all the difference in the world when it comes to accuracy and speed of analysis.  

You need to be curious.  If you see a dead squirrel on the top floor of a parking garage and your first thought is “Ewwwww, a dead squirrel” I don’t want you.  If you first thought is “Hmmm, why did that squirrel come up here if there are no trees nearby? There isn’t any squirrel food around to draw him in.   How did he die? I assume that he was hit by a car but is that really the case?”  and  you go into full CSI:Rodent mode then you are someone I want to talk to.  If something slightly odd pops up during your analysis it could be your mistake, bad data or an interesting discovery.  All of these are important but if you don’t notice and follow up on the initial oddity then we’ll never know will we?  I understand if you keep that side of you under wraps around normal people.  I do as well. My friends and close relatives all think I’m strange when I start wondering out loud about things like that.  If you haven’t read all the Sherlock Holmes stories then maybe you should.  However, that being said don’t take it too far.  I’ve seen stats people go down rabbit holes for weeks and come back with a set of technically correct but complete useless results.  This is especially true with big data systems.  There are an infinite number of cool but useless things you can find. Your curiosity should always be filtered though the sieve of practicality.  Just keep asking yourself if what you are investigating will ultimately be useful to the client. 

You need imagination.  There are multiple ways to approach any analytic problem and you need to be able to see most of those.  More importantly you need to be able to imagine entirely brand new problems that can be solved with the data and tools that you have.  If you only find what you are told to find you are a failure.  Convince me that you can see things that others can’t.  Unless what you see are hallucinations then please keep those to yourself.  



Tell me a story.   You need to be able to convert your brilliant analysis into something that normal people can understand.  If you use the term “p-value” while explaining results to a client I’ll dock your pay.  Unless you are lucky enough to have a client that understands all that stuff. Then by all means, geek out.  You need to have good communications skills.  You need to explain your results, why they are significant and why someone should trust them in a way that civilians understand.  You will also need to interact with clients on a continual basis since you may understand analytic techniques but you most likely won’t understand the domain you are working in.  A big part of data science is learning about the business domain you are operating in. If you don’t, you run the risk of embarrassing yourself by giving clients results that are obviously wrong or trivial.  My first results that I delivered to a client many years ago were horribly wrong because of some fundamentally incorrect assumptions I made about the completeness of the data that I would have known about had I asked. And they were completely obtuse.  My work product sucked and I paid the price.  

Finally, you need an area of technical analytic expertise.  This is where your background in stats, machine learning,  natural language processing, etc. comes in.  There isn’t much to really say here.  If you are coming out of school  this is what your degree should be in or you need to have shown a significant project or two in these areas.  You should be able to describe how to solve a sample problem that I throw at you using your preferred technology. I expect you to be technically competent in one area and conversant in the rest. 

Hmmm, this was way longer than I thought it would be.  Hopefully it helps.  Of course additions, comments and vicious flames welcome.

"Edit: responses not just limited to NYC!

Because the industry gives the ""Data Scientist"" title to people with differing levels of data-related skillsets, everything from generating reports to building machine learning models, comparing Data Scientist roles just by title or years of experience isn't enough--getting down to the comparison of skills and role is more useful. 

I've run into this while trying to collect more data about a Data Scientist's salary to use in future negotiations and understand my market value. My employer, like most I imagine, is pretty tight lipped about what others in my role make, and opaque about how they arrive at compensation numbers, so I hope this post helps us all a little.

I'd like to share that information with the community in the hopes that others will do the same, giving us all a bunch of data points where we can say to our employers ""I heard of Data Scientist X making Y doing Z in NYC"". Here it is, and thanks for everyone's participation!

"I'm coming up on my 1 year mark at my 1st post-grad school job (not my 1st job tho. I worked between undergrad and grad school).

I manage about... 20 different reports in my position and when I started all the data was stored in excel and the reports were completed manually (I work for a non-profit that is just starting to utilize data and they didn't really hire for data skills before me)

I've automated these reports(still in excel, it's an incremental process to transition these projects) and I am in the process of getting the data out of excel, starting to write code in R to clean the data and make reports.

I generally feel like I am KILLING IT at my job. I'm really proud of the progress I've made and, if there are errors, at least they are systematic errors that are easy to identify and fix.

However, I get really stressed out when I do make a mistake. For example, I sent out some reports this afternoon, after they'd been reviewed by my boss, and I then realized I'd made an error in the data cleaning process and I had to re-run one of the reports.

When other people make mistakes, I am very understanding, and I try to apply that to myself, but it's really hard.

How do you either ID mistakes before publishing or accept that not everything will be perfect every time?

"Hi everyone, 

I browse this subreddit quite a bit. Actually it is the first thing I do when I get to work in the morning. I see a lot of posts about data analyst positions and I thought I would share my current experience one month in. 

A little about myself: I graduated from a very good small liberal arts school not super well known for its science and math programs. But I graduated with a degree in physics and a minor in math. My math minor which included probability models, applied statistics in R, mathematical statistics (proofs of t-test and other things you never want to prove like the Rao-Blackwell theorem), and bayesian statistics with R. I chose work over grad-school because I was unsure exactly what field I wanted to go into and did not want to spend money on a degree that would not further my career. I think the biggest thing that set me apart when I was interviewing was my demonstration that I can learn on my own. Personal projects were something that interviewers were very curious about and I was happy to show them a web-scrapper I built or a website with MySQL developed in django. 

A little bit about my job: I work as a marketing analyst for a natural gas company trying to bring insight into different strategies and predict a variety of different things. This means I do all the sexy things like cleaning data, cleaning data, and cleaning data. I currently use python and R for a lot of my data manipulation. Our company actual uses PowerBI for visualization and reports and it is horribly slow, but very free. Coming out of undergrad I was excited to dive right into applied machine learning algorithms and tried to learn as much as I can about that. But, I think the most important thing is curiosity and wanting to learn about the actual business itself. It is impossible to be a good data analyst if you don't know why the data is being presented to you the way it is. In order to answer interesting questions, you first need to be able to ask them and that all starts with playing with the data and visualizations (EDA!!), not just throwing a random forest regression, SVM, or naive bayes algorithm from scikit-learn. 

Overall it has been a great experience. My math training has been the most useful to me so far, SQL skills have been slowly improving, and I have yet to use any bayesian tricks which I thought was the coolest thing I have every learned, except for solid state physics. 
 
Please pm with questions, I am happy to share my resume. I just recently went through this process and would be happy to talk about my interview experience and all the times I had to fail in order to get the job I have today. Learn how to make reports and try to enjoy it because it is going to be a big part of being a data analyst. I am going to work on some data pipeline stuff using luigi in python, so I would love to hear if anybody has suggestions or things to watch out for, let me know!

"What are some good Jupyter notebook tricks you've pick up?

One I recently discovered was the magic command for reloading local Python modules when changes occur. I'm working half in PyCharm and half in a notebook, so when I'd change something to my modules in PyCharm, the changes wouldn't show up for use in the notebook.

Turns out you can use the magic command above your imports to first load the extension required, then you can define which module you'd like to autoreload:
    
    %load_ext autoreload    # load the extension
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    %aimport DataCleaningModule    # designate which module to reload each cell run
    from DataCleaningModule import text_processors as proc

If you have a .py in your module you want to reload every time (*text_processors* in my case) you just need to use *%aimport* on the module that contains your .py and Jupyter will get the changes every time you run a cell!

I've decided to break the research down into four buckets.  The first bucket addresses the question:  **'what is your personal list of the 10 most important _fundamental_ , canonical data science problems that a beginner should address?'**

You can leave a note to your future self to learn/solve 10 fundamental data science problems, to expose yourself to as many fundamental DS concepts as possible.  Which 10 do you choose and why?'**

&nbsp;

The goal is to expose the learner to as many different fundamental concepts and methods in **10 problems.**  Note that this research is specifically seeking **problems**, not concepts.  If you feel a concept is super important, such as SGD...then identify a problem that demonstrates SGD, and list SGD as the core concept taught by that problem.

"When working with Python to do data science, what tips, tricks, pitfalls and the like have you found that you don't get taught on courses and in text books? 

The kind of things that you usually have to learn by making mistakes and working with the tools regularly.

For me it would be...

Retain a copy of the original data. I've accidentally overwritten a csv before, luckily it was in a setting which didn't matter though. 

Visualise often. It's a lot easier to get to grips with your data when you are constantly looking at it in a visual format.

"Hi,

I am interested in data science, but I am studying a completely unrelated subject (related with biology & health). Dropping out my current course is not an option, as I like it; however, I think that if I learned a little bit about data science, perhaps I could find job opportunities in my area which require a great biology/health knowledge and some data science knowledge too.

The curriculum I built based on my internet research is at the end of this post. I would like to know if you would change anything! Since I don't know much (only basic statistics & basic Python), it was not easy to find the best online resources. And if anyone else wants to follow this learning plan, I invite you to do so!

* What are your ""must do"" items when you get your hands on a big new data set?


* What tools do you like for data cleaning? 

* Do you think of data cleaning and data wrangling (joining, aggregating, etc) as two different steps in your process, or as parts of a single ""data preparation"" step?

* How has your approach to data cleaning and/or wrangling changed with experience? Any epiphanies or illustrative blunders that you'd like to share?

"Hey,

I'm not sure if I anyone else has ever felt this, but I feel like I can never do a project from scratch.

Take a jupyter notebook from Kaggle, I feel that I can never start from the beginning (analyzing, cleaning) go to visualizations and then do machine learning steps.

I always end up looking at different peoples notebooks to see the path they took and the code/steps they used. I never turn these in and they are mainly meant to practice, but I'm tired of always having to look at peoples ""solutions"" and methods instead of coming up with my own novel way from scratch or doing all the steps on my own. I probably spend around 4-10 hours day on python, but still I feel like my skills are severely lacking.

I'm not sure what I am trying to say, but I just want to be able to do my own analysis without having to copy others or look at others work. I feel terrible since I'm stealing other peoples books, adding/changing a bit, and then combining things to make my notebook. I want to do the whole process on my own like everyone else.

I've never copy pasted code, but still by just typing up or modifying/building from others I feel inadequate. Whenever I try to build my own project I feel lost or that my work won't be as good. Though my coding ability has increased, I want it to be higher. However, starting from today, I have made a pledge to never look at peoples solutions.

I was just wondering if you guys had any tips to improving on python coding. I just feel that I end up either copying based on memory, or copying directly.

Sorry for the rambling and double postings, I've just been frustrated over how inadequate my skills are.

If this is against the rules I once again apologize as I am new to reddit; please delete it as soon as possible in that case.

I made 28k last year and because I only do 1099 work, I'm facing a huge tax bill in a couple months. Yeah I know I should've been paying estimated taxes along the way, but that's hard to do when you have $400/month boot camp loan payment.

I've done the networking thing to death. I've hit up my friend's sister's boyfriends and my friend's tinder date for coffee and nothing has come from that.

I'm constantly working on improving my skills and publishing work, but nothing is coming from that. I've had professional data scientists tell me they're stumped as to why I can't get work.

So I guess this means that I need to go grad school and go further into debt. Let's say I choose to do a masters, how do I know the job market won't be stacked in favor of PhDs? 

I honestly don't know what to do at this point, my motivation to do my current jobs is eroding and it's affecting my performance at work.

At this point, all I want is an internship, but that is pretty much impossible because all those positions require you to be in school.

Maybe I'm just bitter and I need to rant, but if there are pieces of wisdom you can spare, I would greatly appreciate them.

But I hate my job. The more I examine common practices at my company, the more I realize that everything is a lie. We sell models to clients, but they don't work, and they never have. Top-level management is excellent at selling promises to clients that we can't actually deliver. Given that we work in a specialized field that's currently experiencing a bubble, none of our clients seem to have noticed yet. But they will.

"Hey everyone -

So we hired a remote, hourly resource because we have no FTEs and even if we did, it wouldn't be funded to pay a data scientist and even if it was, anyone decent probably lives in a real city.  Anyway, my use case and data is as follows:

1. A set of meter consumption data.  Roughly 400 meters, with hourly readings going back roughly a year, so roughly 3.5M records.
2. A listing of \~ 50 meters that failed efficiency tests; i.e., run 1000 gallons of water through the meter, and the meter registered 980 gallons, or 1020 gallons)  \[or more/less\].  Metadata on date of test and the efficiency rating measurements is included.  I have given him three reading values for meters that failed in the past, high efficiency, low efficiency, and an average of the two.
3. Measurements at field testing time include a high flow efficiency ratios (i.e., a shit ton of water going through the meter) and low flow efficiency ratios (normal amount of water).  Unfortunately, in the consumption data, we only have a total consumption value; i.e., consumption is not broken down into high/low registers, even though this is how testing is performed.

I tell this guy, look at the consumption records across the entire dataset, use the failing meters as training data set, write a model that can tell me which \*other\* meters are probable failures.   (The existing process for determination of failures is annual, manual inspection of each large commercial meter.  Very labor intensive and subject to extended periods of a meter reporting inappropriately.)

OK.  Anyway, the guy doesn't know the tools that I'd like him to have experience in, so I give him some time to come up on them.  But then, a few weeks in, I say, show me what you have and the shit just doesn't look like he's got half a clue.  So I say, convince me you've got a plan to attack this problem because I am not seeing it.  He sends this response:

>The model with only one independent variable (i.e. AVG efficiency) is prone to underfit and will be biased – we may miss the relevant relations between features and our output variable. So first I will have to figure the ways to balance the bias-variance tradeoff in our use case.

(?) OK, but I also gave him high and low efficiency reading values.

>Second, the consumption data is a tricky part here. There can be various scenarios that may cause the consumption data the way it is right now. For example, the resident can be out for vacation. Meter is installed in a store room etc. Additionally, Daily aggregation isn’t a good idea here because it doesn’t tell anything about the meter’s health, so I am trying out week level aggregation, month level and also quarterly level aggregation. I know that quarterly level aggregation would be too much but there is no harm in testing our hypothesis.

I asked him to explain to a dumb ass like me why we would want to use daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation when we have hourly data available?  \[got no response\]  It seemed to me that we lose a lot of granularity of our data here, making it more problematic to identify changes.  (?)  Note:  These are commercial meters and I don't care about vacations and / or store rooms / they are all stored outside.  I have identified those meters that are irrigation (not too many of them).  I have rainfall data, but he hasn't asked for it.

>Our solution is going to use a classifier to distinguish between cases of legitimate, such as residents on vacation, and illegitimate, as malfunctioning or tampered, zero-consumption meters.

These meters aren't being tampered with, the people running them are businesses, and I have existing processes to determine zero consumption situations.  The whole point is to determine malfunctioning meters and if anyone out there is clever enough to tamper with a goddamn ultra-sonic water meter, I'm inclined to let them have water on general principle.

Ultimately, I can't figure out if this guy has a clue or is just saying stuff to keep on submitting timesheets?  It would be one thing if he could tell me to have a field tech go test meters A/B/C/D/E and we could see how the efficiency ratings came back, but it feels like he's a ways off from being able to do that.  (?)

Thanks

Ninja Edit:  Thanks a lot for all of your replies.  Great community.

Ninja Edit 2:  Yes, I went to great pains to explain my data and expectations beforehand, but I did not want to write a manifesto in Reddit to that level of detail.  Yes, I have had weekly meetings with the contractor and asked, 'do you have any questions?  what else might help you?' and at no point did they mention wanting some of the other data sets mentioned.  At no point has he commented that there may not be sufficient data points to perform an appropriate analysis, which may speak to competence of the willingness to suck the contract dry.  That being said, I \*have\* told him that I have other projects behind this and more contracts could be waiting if we showed success.  Intentionally sandbagging would seem to be a dumb idea given that information.  (?) 

Ninja edit 3:  Failure rates occur at nearly identical 19% rates across the two manufacturer/models that comprise 87% of the commercial meters in question.

"So I've been working as a Data Scientist for nearly 4 years. I've studied a vague bachelor's which touches ground on economics, statistics, and quite a bit of programming involved. That led me to be the sort of Data Scientist which can get quite a bit of the programming parts, quite a bit of the statistics but never felt comfortable or confident enough there, and not enough programming experience to setup Spark clusters myself (although I did manage to do it with a bit of head bashing against the wall for an interview). 

I think I'm trying to figure out what my next step should be. I quit my job to have a few months off, and thought about building a bit of a portfolio. I've been working only in startups until now, which led me to be pretty close to management. It makes me wonder if I should consider moving further into leadership, or just focus on improving my skills. I always hated leaders which don't know what they're doing, but after seeing a few jobs I had, it feels like it's more important to know how to deal with different stakeholders and politics, rather than your raw knowledge. 


Would it make more sense to do a masters? Would real life jobs be still a better idea? Is it even worth having a portfolio except for my own confidence boost? What should the role of a Data Scientist be anyway? I think i'm just looking for my job to mean more than number crunching and ETL making and sometimes better decision making just because I know some stats.

"**About Me**

I am currently a candidate for a MSc in Data Science. I started the program today and it is a two-year program.

This past summer I was hired as a Data Analyst Intern at a startup. Although I was not officially Data Scientist Intern, I did do some machine learning while on the job and implemented algorithms at various points. I don't think there is much difference between a Data Analyst Internship and a Data Scientist Internship **within a tech startup**. I do not know how data analyst interns operate in accounting firms, banks, etc.

**The Interview**

After a phone screening, I was invited to interview at the office. The first part was a behavioral interview with the Data Team Lead. The second part was a technical interview with the Data Scientist. 

Q1: Explain one of your projects on your resume to me as if I am a client.

A: The best way to answer this question is to be as vague as possible. Clients/non-engineering members don't care about the algorithm you used or the results of the confusion matrix. What they do care about is how these results will affect their profits or their company in general. Don't talk about the decision tree implementation, talk about how the significant factors you found that led to the classification of the predicted value.

Q2: Design a retail/book/grocery store relational database

A2: Basically you want a table of all the transactions, the items and their prices, customers, each with keys that can join to the other table. I was also asked to limit the tables, join the tables, order a table and group by a table. We ran out of time, but the next part was CTEs.

**The Internship**

As an intern I was asked to do a variety of things. However, my most used skill while at my internship was web-scraping. I developed scripts to scrape websites for a variety of information needed to make the company's current information more useful. If you do not know how to web scrape, I highly suggest you learn it. I personally use BeautifulSoup.

The data team was very small so I had the opportunity to work on all types of projects, including working with PDF and free text data. Therefore, I also learned how to work with unstructured data. This is a pretty daunting task and if you ever end up having to work with this form of data, I highly recommend keeping your bosses in the loop. I didn't and finished it with only a day to spare which was not ideal. 

I also worked with the data scientist to productionalize and augment the current models. While the data scientist worked on more pressing matters, I was testing different algorithms and examining outputs in forms such as confusion matrices, lift charts, AUC curves, etc. 

**Conclusion**
Overall, I found this experience enjoyable. Although working at big 4 companies is ideal, I think working at start ups in big cities like New York, Boston, Silicon Valley, etc. is also super valuable. Being on a small team gave me some more responsibility than an intern would get and although none of the work I did was critical, it still provided value and left me in good terms with the employer.

If there was anything anyone else wanted to know that won't remove the anonymity of the company. Please ask. I saw some questions about people asking about data science internships an I wanted to give my two cents about my own ""data science"" internship.

"Hello everyone!

I am a data scientist at Satalia. I would like to share a data science workflow that blends exploration and production.

This workflow is an attempt to bridge the gap between exploration in data science and productionisation in software development. What motivated me to create this workflow is the lack of a specific training in software development that data scientists may have. A lack of software development skills typically leads to scripted and untidy code that is not modular. In turn, software developers (and sometimes data scientists) have a hard time productionising such code. That's why I created a data science workflow with the end-product in mind.

The workflow is an adaptation of methods, mainly from software engineering, with additional new ideas. I have tested the workflow with colleagues and friends, but I am aware that there are things to improve. So, it would be nice to have some feedback from you. Thanks!

I've been working for a while on a small project for my undergrad comp sci dissertation. I have created a corpus of so far 9,408,908 articles classified according to 11 categories \(fake/real\). [https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus](https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus).

"I have a question about the similarities/differences between creating models for prediction and statistical inference. Basically, I don't view these as mutually exclusive, but I recently was rejected from a job interview because I was ""more focused on predictions instead of inference"" and was hoping to receive some feedback.

To provide more context: as part of the hiring process, I was tasked with finding if there was any relationship between dairy intake and eventual cancer diagnosis using published survey data (while controlling for common confounders such as age, gender, etc.).

The approach that I took, among others, was to create a logistic regression model with cancer as the binary response, and predictors such as dairy intake, age, gender, etc. First, I tuned the regularization parameter and class weighting (the cancer diagnosis was obviously unbalanced) with cross-validation and showed F1, recall, and precision metrics for the out-of-sample data. After optimizing the model based on the CV metrics, I looked at normalized coefficient weights to determine relative effect size of the various parameters. I performed additional analyses such as exploring minority class upsampling, collinearity of predictors, and looking at standard errors / p-values.

I felt pretty good about my approach, but received this comment from the hiring manager: 

""I looked through your project. I am very impressed with your thoroughness - for example, not a lot of candidates checked the collinearity and did the upsampling. But as I said on the phone, you are heavily towards the prediction side of data science, as opposed to the inference/statistics side. One example is that when you performed the logistic regression, the first thing you show is the precision metric etc, instead of the significance of different variables - the coefficients alone do not mean anything without the standard error. I know you have shown the significance table later but clearly you put that in a less important position even when the project is about finding whether there is a relationship between diary and cancer, not about predicting cancer. That said, there is nothing wrong with being focused on prediction - it is just not what this position needs. You will be perfectly fine with other positions that need prediction more than inference."" 

So I guess I'm a bit confused about the difference between creating models for prediction vs. inference. In my view, you want your model to fit the data as accurately as possible, and the best way validate a model is looking at out-of-sample error. Simply fitting an OLS model, printing an R^2 value, and looking at p-values can lead to an over-fit model and invalid inference conclusions. Once you have a valid model, I understand that standard error and p-values can be useful, but for multivariate regression with large n, you are getting a pooled standard error and many of your predictors will show significance. Thus in a lot of cases, it's more useful to focus more on effect size and perform analyses related to how each factor affects, e.g. adjusted R^2.

Any thoughts that can be offered as to whether I'm on the right track or should adjust my thinking would be much appreciated!

"Data Science, the old school way

To me, software engineering is a passion and a feeling of self-fulfillment which, when coupled with fruitful projects giving way to advancements in society and humanity as a whole, flares a deeply rooted passion to learn learn learn! This is why, when I first read up on Data Science, I knew that I had honed in on my next target to devour and assimilate into my neural network (yes, the biological one!)

But as I started reading through the hundreds of how-to’s, blogs, MOOCS, video tutorials, online books, PDFs and the rest, I only found more frustration with missing pieces to a larger and more obscure logical puzzle that was defiant and unyielding. A feeling of unrest and concern surfaced my mind as I delved more deeply into the subject getting half-baked and limited understanding allowing me to build only by following “hand-holding” step by step instructions. This was not engineering! Trial after trial the matter finally became clear to me — The topic of Data Science strictly refuses to truly enter a mind until it is imbued with proper mathematical/statistical foundations!

As my reading on Data Science progressed, I would read or hear terms that I knew were key to understanding how Neural Networks worked, but it was just half baked! I started seeing this trend of people seizing the opportunity to piggy back off the Data Science craze and authoring reads and making full fledged online “Data Camps” that in the end will always avoid the real mechanics behind the subject. They breeze through the parts where mathematical foundations are necessary and move on as if it was a side matter and not required to build reliable models. Take this snippet from a free online book for Neural Networks as an example,

“On a related note, the mathematical requirements to read the book are modest. There is some mathematics in most chapters, but it’s usually just elementary algebra and plots of functions, which I expect most readers will be okay with. I occasionally use more advanced mathematics, but have structured the material so you can follow even if some mathematical details elude you.”

Reading through only the second half of Chapter 1: “ We’ll also define the gradient of C to be the vector of partial derivatives”, “We denote the gradient vector by ∇C” and“Then Equation (9) tells us that ΔC≈−η∇C⋅∇C=−η∥∇C∥2.”, all prove otherwise and goes against being “elementary.”

This is why I found myself constantly referring back to tutorials that explained the topic of gradient descent, limits, derivatives, vectors, statistics then go back to continue my reading. But this style of learning left me with a feeling of despair resonating from my logical side whispering, “It’s not enough, I still want to know WHY and HOW!”

Then, one day as I was cleaning up my closet, my eyes suddenly fell on my old college Single Variable Calculus book by James Stewart. Followed by a sudden dramatic stare and a sense of joy from a reunion with an old friend, an innate feeling told me that an epiphany is about to occur! I opened the book - chapter 1 - and lo and behold! “This…is it. It’s…it’s all there! IT’S ALL THERE!” Really, all the missing pieces and loose ends were so finely andreliably described that it left no room for confusion. Yes, I do agree that only after having gone through all the Data Science tutorials that Calculus made so much more sense - but it was still a critical piece to the big Data Science puzzle.

The point I’m driving here is that I feel that there are many fields in I.T. that are slowly being driven by marketing objectives and quick responses to technology hypes rather than the classic RT*M way of deeply rooted “old school” developers. Head hunters are scouring to find anyone that can “fit the description” screening people through checkoff lists and “how many years of” rather than searching for minds withchemical X which in turn forces future Data Scientist to prepare to become real engineers. The pressure coming down from this flawed style of talent selection is slowly giving rise to a batch of cooky cutter engineers that sparks worry given the way the entire field of I.T. ties in together. Security, reliability, scalability and general advancements in I.T. are all negatively effected by allowing the field to grow without well founded roots. Take how Android programming tutorials started as a classic example. The push and drive behind most of the videos, MOOCs, and tutorials was to quickly jump on the demand and make things seem as easy as possible to drive more readers and not towards making strong android engineers. This finally resulted in poor android engineers that designed poorly designed apps making way for many security and stability issues. I believe this is the same trend that is taking place in the Data Science field.

In summary, if you really want to understand Data Science in a way that will allow you to have a positive impact and pave the way for your future in this ever growing field then I strongly suggest studying the basics really well - along with all the MOOCs, videos and tutorials that are still key in understand Data Science and Machine Learning.",Learning Data Science the right way,7gi5r0,top,25.0,75.0,75.0,0.0

This means that a data scientist should know enough about data engineering to carefully evaluate how her skills are aligned with the stage and need of the company. Furthermore, many of the great data scientists I know are not only strong in data science but are also strategic in leveraging data engineering as an adjacent discipline to take on larger and more ambitious projects that are otherwise not reachable.

"Hi everyone, I'm just starting out in a Data Science career.  I'm finally moving up form ""generic Business Analyst"" to ""Data Analyst"" which involves a bit more rigor and a glimpse at the more advanced parts of Data Science and Machine Learning.  Looking at career progression, it seems that the big employers in this area in the US are the big internet tech companies (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter, etc) on the west coast and government agencies (NSA, NGA, NRO, DOD, etc) on the east coast.  To my (admittedly naive) eyes that leaves me with two major careers paths: helping companies get people to click things on the internet, or helping the government 'fight terrorism'.  
  Since I'm not particularly interested in either of those paths, I was wondering what other career paths are out there.  Are there any big employers or sectors hiring analysts and Data Scientists that are doing more than getting users to click more or buy more stuff? Anything with a more obvious benefit to society at large? 

Thanks

"""The Curious Case of Coffee Contributing to Killings"" 

I had to run a regression for an undergraduate course in government data analytics. To keep myself entertained (and because I had just seen the Book of Mormon) I decided to test out the ridiculous premise that coffee makes you more sinful and therefore is likely to increase murder rates. I did thorough research on other correlates of homicide, accounted for variables coffee might proxy for (such as temperature), and ended up with a pretty comprehensive model for predicting murder rates.

The results were shockingly that coffee contributes to murder more than alcohol. What the hell?! What is going on here? What am I missing? I got an A, but have been racking my brain trying to figure out what the hell this means! My professor couldn't find anything wrong and was equally baffled.

If I have two cups in the morning, am I more likely to off my boss? Better data scientists please help solve this mystery!

Hi Reddit! I'm turning to you in my hour of need and looking for harsh, cold honesty.

I finished an accelerated Master's program in statistics in May and probably applied to 1,000+ jobs over the summer; changed my resume at least four times, including getting a professional re-write; reached out to tons of people through connections and got internal referrals.

From all of this, I got three call-backs, with eventual rejections. So, at this point, I'm asking if I'm even employable in data analytics.

I am a carreer-switcher, with background in law. My BA was in humanities. But I found myself constantly being put in charge of technical and analytical projects and ended up deciding that data science was a better career for me. 

My Master's program was very intense and I did well. I now know R and Statistics quite well for data munging, analysis, and visualization. I self-taught myself SQL, Python, and now, Tableau. I have many good ""tidy datasets"" projects I showcase on my resume from school and I have exposure to extremely ""un-tidy"" text-based data and business data from my years in law. I have never been an analyst, but I make sure to show that the work I did was mostly analytical, including business analysis in Excel and querying data using legal database management tools.

Obviously, I have a non-traditional background for a data analyst, but with the amount of time I put in, I was hoping to get some interests by now. Recruiters and connections don't reply to me 90% of the time.

I just want to know at this point, is this a lost cause? Should I give up and go back to law? I like data science and I can lead a project from data ingest to conclusion to get insights. I have a scientific mind that's just rotting away in an administrative role. So, it would suck to give up. But I have loans that are due and no health insurance and I need to get real.

"I am looking for a few books in statistics and data science that explain the different characteristics of algorithms and statistical techniques, as well as when they should be used. Most books I have found so far dive too deeply into the mathematical equations (such as The Elements of Statistical Learning), and details are worded in a highly scientific way making them difficult to remember and apply in a daily job as a data scientist.

For example, if I apply an algorithm on a dataset, I want to be able to understand why I am getting the returned results, and from there make informed changes or improvements. Another example is when presented with certain characteristics of data (such as skewed or non-normal), I should know which statistical techniques to apply (for instance apply log transform) and also can explain why.

So far I am struggling to find such materials. The kernels on kaggle sometimes present good explanations for different scenarios, but they are quite scattered and are not complete enough.

Found an interesting post on where Amazon might want to place its next headquarters. They used Stack Overflow user profiles to understand what developers are like in different cities and compared them to find the most similar in terms of different skillsets.

There is a tl;dr at the bottom of the blog post but I'll copy and paste it here.

* These large cities and metro areas in the United States are quite similar to each other, especially compared to worldwide variation, and it’s unlikely that any would be a truly bad choice.

* The choices that are most similar overall to Seattle in terms of technology ecosystems are Northern VA and Washington, DC. If Amazon wants to go with a city where the developer population feels as familiar as possible, these would be the way to go.

* If Amazon wants to choose a city with proportionally more mobile developers, Los Angeles, New York, and Toronto would be the best choices.

* If Amazon wants to choose a city with proportionally more developers working in data science and machine learning, Raleigh or Columbus would be excellent choices.

"As u/__compactsupport__ mentioned in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6n7r3o/what_about_data_science_interests_you/), we have been looking towards discerning what r/datascience should be and how it sets itself apart from similar subreddits.  To that end, I wanted to present my view of the subreddit going forward, and how that will inform our moderation decisions in the future.

&nbsp;

**What is the purpose of having a Data Science subreddit?**

The primary purpose of having a Data Science subreddit is to provide a place for DS practitioners (both amateur and professional) to discuss and debate topics relating to the field/industry.

&nbsp;

**What kinds of posts should we have in r/datascience?**

* General Data Science Community/News discussion
* Great examples of DS, given in a context that helps educate and inform
* Industry/Career questions and advice (absolute beginners would be directed to the wiki)
* Perspectives of DS community, including open questions, critical comments, and AMAs
* Networking of DS professionals
* Fun DS trivia and ephemera
* Posts about non-commercial tools/platforms/courses, given context
* Posts about commercial tools/platforms/courses, with approval, if setup correctly for discussion rather than advertising

*Note that the above list will likely inform future link flair categories.*

&nbsp;

**How does r/datascience differ from similar subreddits?**

* r/MachineLearning
* r/deeplearning

These subreddits are more focused on the academic, theoretical side of machine learning. Our subreddit should be focused more on the industrial, applied side of machine learning, statistics, and other methods. This doesn't mean that we shouldn't have posts discussing new research or results, but any academic/research material should have broad interest to DS practitioners and be placed in a proper context. Simply posting a link to a paper or blog discussing a novel technique (or even an old one) should not be accepted, and instead directed to r/MachineLearning. Users who want to discuss such things in the subreddit should post a text post that lays out what the paper is and how they are thinking about using it in their DS work.

&nbsp;

* r/statistics
* r/AskStatistics
* r/rstats
* r/pystats
* r/MLQuestions
* r/learnmachinelearning

These subreddits are mostly for asking questions and providing help for specific techniques in statistics, machine learning, R, or Python. Our subreddit can provide limited help in these areas, but shouldn't accept questions that aren't generalized to the context of a Data Science problem/project. In other words, specific discussions about how to optimize k-means should be directed to the appropriate subreddit, but discussions about whether to cluster market segments using k-means would be acceptible (assuming contextual details were included).

&nbsp;

* r/DataHoarder
* r/datasets
* r/opendata
* r/visualization
* r/dataisbeautiful

These subreddits are focused specifically on data/visualizations, which while important to data scientists, are only a means to an end for us. These types of posts should be handled like with r/MachineLearning, where material should have broad interest to DS practitioners and be placed in a proper context. Simply posting a link to a fun dataset or visualization without context should not be accepted.",[Meta] The Future of r/datascience and its moderation,6njyw2,top,6.0,67.0,67.0,0.0

I figured I'd share my experience with doing the [Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science](https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/tracks/data-science/) for everyone in case anyone was interested in taking it.

Overall, I did enjoy the course and learned quite a lot. However, there was one annoyance I had with it and that was when they taught the math parts of it, specifically in the machine learning modules. I believe it's not the best way to teach math by showing formulas and then going through what each variable and symbol means. Honestly, you could just skip those videos and watch the demos. The demo videos were helpful and they help prepare you for the labs and exams.

All in all, I wouldn't pay for verified certificates unless you need to for your employer or they are willing to reimburse you for it, as it will cost a total of $990. If you do decide to pay for it, definitely audit the course first and make sure you know you'll pass before purchasing the certificate.

Hello! I'm Jake Porway and I’m a machine learning and technology enthusiast who loves nothing more than seeing good values in data. I founded a nonprofit called DataKind in the hopes of creating a world in which the power of data science is harnessed in the service of humanity.

In our 4 years here, DataKind has brought together volunteer data scientists to build predictive models to help Amnesty International prevent human rights violations, scraped websites to help the World Bank measure inflation and used satellite imagery to help GiveDirectly address poverty. We’re headquartered in New York City and we have Chapters in Bangalore, Dublin, San Francisco, Singapore, the UK and Washington DC. You can find more about our projects through the case studies we've written up here -> http://www.datakind.org/projects

In terms of my background, I studied machine learning and AI as an undergrad in computer science at Columbia University and then later as a Ph.D. in Statistics at UCLA. I’ve always been fascinated by the ways intelligent machines can be used to improve the world and took that interest into my work in computer vision in grad school and later to The New York Times R&D Lab, where I built prototypes for the future of media. I think we live in one of the most exciting times in human history, in which we are just now realizing the power of a fully digitized world and the way that humans and machines can work together to actualize our visions for humanity.

To get things rolling, allow me to intro some of my colleagues at DataKind who'll be joining me in answering questions (drumroll): 

* Pete Darche, our Data Engineer and one of DataKind’s first staff members
* Nick Eng, our Data Science Manager and alumni of the UChicago Data Science for Social Good program
* Miriam Young, our Communications Specialist and super fan of all things pro bono

"I lurk on this subreddit and find most of the posts helpful. I have saved all the interesting posts for when I'm ready to do data science. Thank you for all of that. It's a wonderful community. 

I graduated with a Computer Science and Engineering degree in 2015. And due to the soul crushing pedagogy of my relatively poor college, I switched to art. I made short films, wrote poetry and did everything to avoid regular employment. Sometime, in the turn of this year. I realized I actually loved computer science before college and thought of giving it another chance. Applied to German Unis, got summarily rejected. 

Now I'm self learning. And my progress has been okay. Not got to the Machine Learning part yet. But have been doing EDA and visualization on R. 

My concern is by the time I start implementing ML, the market will have moved on to something else. As we can already see SPSS and other packages offering point and click sales prediction and stuff. 


Is it worth it, objectively? This is not an existential crisis. Just an honest question on whether I should consider academia?

"So I've been a marketing analyst for about 4 years now, and an analyst for an advertising agency for the last year of that.

Looking back, I thought this role would be more like a consumer insights or market research role. I had testing methodologies in mind, inferential statistics, and am now essentially a data janitor. I'm also waking up to the idea that generally in marketing, the ceiling for analysts is pretty low. Sure the pay is good to get started, but it's account services that get the leadership roles.

So I guess my question to the wider audience is, once you became an analyst, what did you do you see yourselves doing 5, 10, 15 years down the line?

It seems many posts here ask how people got into Analytics - I hope this helps.  I'm not yet a Data Scientist, but I'm on that road and I think this subreddit best fits this post.  Feel free to ask questions if you'd like any clarifications.

**This will be long!  But I want to give all relevant details to my path as I think it's an example of what an organic road into analytics looks like.**

**Education**: I graduated from a large state university with dual degrees in Economics (BS) and International Studies (BA).  I wasn't planning on working in analytics; I thought I was going to work internationally and spent time getting fluent in Spanish while in college.  Those plans changed!

**First job - August 2010**

* Customer Support Rep for a small tech startup

I had no idea what Data Analysis was at the time, but I started naturally doing it.  There would be a change to our website and I would receive upwards of 2,000 emails about the change. I would go through the tickets and create an analysis - with suggestions for the product team - based on the feedback our customers gave.  This quickly got passed up the chain and became a regular analysis I did for the executive and product teams when a major site change happened.

This was my first foray into analytics - I had no idea what it was, but I liked the process of aggregating, interpreting and presenting data in a way that helped others make informed business decisions.

**Second Job - Promotion - July 2011**

* Promotion to Account Manager for the same small tech startup

I was promoted up the chain in sales, but still wanted to do analytics.  I took over the administration of Salesforce and started making various reports without being asked - sales forecast reports, pipeline reports, backward-looking sales reports.  Anything I could think of - and I became trusted to make those across the company.

**Third Job - Acquisition by large company - April 2013**

* Client Manager for large East Coast software company

The startup I was working for ran out of money.  We were acquired by an east coast software company who didn't guarantee any of our jobs.  Even though I was seeking to be an analyst, I wouldn't keep my job if I played that angle. So I interviewed for and stayed with a Client Manager role in sales.  I also had all analytics stripped from me - they didn't need me for that role.

Well, I still found a way around this.  I learned that the Client Management superiors had no reporting on what I and others were working on.  No analytics around our sales, our renewals or what we were on track to do for each quarter.  Bingo!  I had a new analytics job.

I created a dashboard for the management on my team to track our sales and renewals by rep and by team. They loved it, and I got to keep analytics going at least part time at my new job.

However, an underlying issue remained - I wasn't anything more than maybe 20-25% analytics.  I was getting pigeonholed into a Sales career and I didn't want that to happen.  It was time to make a move, but I had no idea what to do. 

I started talking to others in analytics, asking how they got their jobs.  All paths were unique - but all involved somehow convincing a company to take a shot on them as a low level analyst, even part time.  So I started job hunting for positions like that.

**Interview that changed the trajectory of my career - May 2014**

I had a contact at a growing manufacturing company that had no analytics.  My contact told me I could interview for a lower-level position that I could easily do, while taking on analytics tasks that were needed around the company as a test. I was told the position was a contract one and it was up to me to turn it into a salary position during the interview.

So, I had the interview with the CFO and the VP of Sales.  In the interview, I saw them shift from talking about a general contract position into seeing me as someone they could take a risk on as an analyst.  They had no one dedicated to this and I had enough passion (and a small track record) that they were sold.  I was to be hired on as an analyst 50% of the time until I proved myself capable of doing that 100% of the time.  I took a pay cut, a cut in benefits and signed on.

**Fourth Job - May 2014**

* Analyst 50% of time; other work 50% of time

I knew that I'd be in over my head but *wow* - that was an understatement.  I ended up in the equivalent of an ocean-sized whirlpool.  The company was growing at a 100-120% rate per year.  Employment was doubling every year. And there was no one doing analytics.  On top of that- my analysis had to be *perfect* - a mistake of 1% meant the company over or underordered by USD $1M.  And man, was I not perfect.

I had to learn how to build a database for the CFO, manage metadata, create financial reporting.  I had to make royalty reporting outputs.  I needed to create ordering reports for the sales team, a catalog the sales team could reference at any time of day to see what was in stock.  So much more.  I had to do everything all at once, with little experience.

I was close to being fired at one point.  Not due to lack of passion, but because the margin for error was so low, and I was going to make errors as I learned how to be an analyst.

But I got over that hump, kept my job, and kept learning.  And convinced them to turn me into a full-time analyst.

**Fifth Job - August 2015**

*  Promotion to Data Analyst (100% of time job!)

I call my previous position and this one my Data Masters Degree. I was underpaid. I learned everything from database creation to executive dashboards in Tableau.  I learned SQL from scratch. I learned how to gather requirements from executives and turn them into actionable reports/analyses.  It was incredibly stressful but rewarding. I became trusted around the company and became an analyst supporting nearly 250 people across all departments.  My reports and dashboards were visible all over screens and computer monitors throughout the office - as an analyst, there's nothing cooler than seeing your stuff helping people do their job.

But, all good things come to an end.  Eventually I was told that the company didn't need me as an analyst anymore; they needed to build out a data warehouse and it was non-negotiable that I'd head up that project.  I feared getting pigeonholed as a DBA and started looking for a new analyst job in the area to keep me on track.

**Sixth Job - July 2016**

* Web Analyst

I found a new job as a Web Analyst.  It was for a consultancy  It wasn't perfect, but I was finally being paid market rate for my skills.  I got to learn how web analytics worked.  And more importantly, I was no longer turning into a DBA.

I'm still at this job and am responsible for web analytics at a major international brand.  I have many client stakeholders who live far away from me, but I still manage to create KPIs, manage analytics, create readouts and more. However, much of the job is very basic in analytics when compared to my previous position.

Unfortunately, the company I started working for was bought out as I joined.  This time by a new East Coast company that has bungled the purchase.  Of the 20 analysts at my office to start the year, only 10 remain.  It's a mess-  we are doing boring work that isn't challenging, with no prospects of improvement. I will stagnate here, and that is not good in the analytics world.

So, I have started a new job hunt and feel I'm at the verge of moving into another analytics role at a fast moving company --

**Seventh Job - Search & Offer - August 2017**

I've been searching for a new job.  I put down some pretty specific requirements that I wasn't sure would be easily findable.  I wanted a small to medium company (I find doing analytics at a large company puts me in a smaller role than I want).  It needed to be growing - working for a shrinking company is terrible. It needed to value problem solving (a skill I think I have and I love using). It needed to value technical ability for analysts. It needed to not want to kill its analysts by working them 60+ hours a week.

I think I've found that role- it fits all those checkboxes.  I've done an in-person interview and received an offer this week which I’m very excited about.  I'll again start growing in my technical abilities and make a different at a growing company with an underdeveloped analytics arm.  I'm excited to be looking forward to going into work again.

------------------------

So, that's my story of my first seven years working.  Analytics is an exciting world.  I want to continue to learn Statistics to start working on forward-looking analytics that you see from actual Data Scientists.  I may end up in management someday.  What I know is that I need to keep growing and a path forward will present itself.  Life has a funny way of not going to plan, so I just set up a structure and move within that.

I'm happy to answer any questions.  I know this was long, but I hope it helps give a sense of what an organic path into a career in analytics looks like. ",My 7 Year Data Analytics Career Journey,6rh7ns,top,26.0,68.0,68.0,0.0

"EDIT: Thanks for all the love, suggestions, and encouragement everyone! Really supportive community here...it's really appreciated at a time like this.

The TL;DR of my situation is I was a part of a massive layoff (>90% of the workforce) at my previous company (~120 employees) where I primarily worked on deep learning/neural nets (Tensorflow) for segmentation and classification on MP4 files for about 10 months. At this point, I've got enough money for about 5-6 months, so I'm growing really worried.

As you can imagine, my work experience thus far is somewhat specialized (though I've got some pretty cutting-edge deep learning experience for my level that could be applicable anywhere). As such, my experience with the ""typical"" data science work (both algorithms and data) is lacking, so naturally I'm looking to shore those weaknesses up.

I think my resume/project experiences are solid which is why I think I've landed several interviews reasonably well, and I can generally communicate and thoroughly describe my previous work quite well, but sometimes I can stumble with some of these broad technical questions on things I've never done before; often times I have a general idea or awareness of the concepts, but falter on the specifics.

It always seems there's a few questions that would be easy to remember/consider if I had the experience/exposure but it's clear that I don't (and obviously looking to gain it). It's hard to review and remember everything, especially when my work experience has been so far and away from a lot of these topics. Vague job descriptions don't help either. I've been trying to shore up some of these weaknesses that have surfaced throughout while juggling recruiters, interviewing and applying, but so far it still feels like there's always more to shore up.

Granted I'm talking about all this over the course of those 3-4 technical interviews I'm still waiting to hear back from (but have a good feeling I sucked at) and I still have a few others coming up, but I'm really worried that I'll throw all my opportunities away eventually if it keeps happening, especially since I'm out of work and being out of it for a long time becomes more hazardous.

I could really use some advice. A few questions if anyone has the time: 

- Should I consider just finding any job, if even just tangentially related or a ""lower level"", so I can rest easier for job hunting later? Maybe even consider an easy part time job in the meantime? (retail for example...have experience in it)
- Any tips on what to review? 
- Your job interviewing experiences (and how long it took to land a job)?
- What's a reasonable/expected gap of employment in this field while looking for [related] work?

Thanks everyone!",Was laid off 2 months ago from my first real DS job and have 5-6 more months of money left.

This is a project I built to better track my son's health.

"Hi,

I have been lurking on this sub for several days and I have realized how much more I still need to learn by not understanding half of what people are talking about here.

I graduated from grad school in 2016 with a master in Geosciences. Useful in the way that I learned about GIS and took a course in Data analysis using Python. But my knowledge of analytics is still very rudimentary. 

Right now I am working as a Geospatial and Economic Data Analyst, which means I use ArcGIS and a very niche economic software that I don't think anyone else uses. And as for pure data analysis, I mainly use Excel. Have been trying to shift to Python, but due to my insufficient programming knowledge, it hasn't been very successful.

Currently I am trying to find a job in DC Metro area as my gf is living there. To increase my chances, I have been taking the MIT OCW Intro to Programming using Python online class to enhance my skills (Besides, I find out that Excel isn't great for repetitive data analysis tasks). I know my skills right now are nothing but laughable on this sub, but I am willing to learn anything step by step. I can work hard and not watch TV through the whole week just to accomplish it. But right now I just need some pointers for my direction.

I like doing GIS work and I also like doing data analysis. In my situation, is keeping on learning Python a good decision? What shall I do to apply coding language into GIS development or data analysis after that? What kind of skill set will land me an entry level data scientist job? Shall I also learn R or Stata?

In other words, let us know- for each genre in the dataset- how many genres the movies in that genre are in, on average. For example, if an average Horror movie is in 1.3 genres and average Adventure movie is in 2.9 genres then we would say Horror is a better-defined genre than Adventure.

To polish up your answer, please provide both the average and maximum number of genres for movies in each genre but sort the list in descending order by average genre count.

"Greetings, data scientists of reddit.

I had applied to a data scientist position at an online marketplace startup of about 10-15 employees. They are now looking to start data science and analytics operations in the company.    

This startup is like Amazon for certain exotic items in India.        

And so today, I got a call from them informing me I was selected for the role. Naturally, I'm happy, but here's the thing -  I will be their **first ever** data scientist, and I have only about 3 months of previous experience in data science from an internship at a different company.      

There is nobody in the company who can guide me, and I'm far from an expert in the field. I am a graduate of Industrial Engineering with some knowledge of statistics.           

Here is the list of what I already did/know because of the internship -        

* Data wrangling and cleaning (of mostly structured data) using dplyr and tidyr        
* Feature engineering (transformations, PCA, imputation of missing data etc.)          
* Deploying machine learning algorithms (random forests, xgboost, support vector machines, neural networks, cubist etc.)         

I used R for all of the above. I have extensively read *Applied Predictive Modeling* by Max Kuhn and *Introduction to Statistical Learning* by Gareth James et al. Both these books are my go-to reference manuals.      
____________
From the job description I was given, my new job will involve -    
      
* Generating insights from data (structured, unstructured and streaming data)        
* Building statistical models to improve company operations        

The data I'll be dealing with will mostly involve their inventory database and transactional data.  
_____________________________
Is there any advice from the more experienced data scientists here?   

What new things do I have to learn? What should I avoid doing? I want to succeed as a data scientist, or at least do a decent job in this new role. I'm rather anxious and I don't want to screw this up.

"I recently created [Machine Learning Problem Bible (MLPB)](https://github.com/ben519/MLPB), a github repo with organized machine learning problems. It serves a few purposes

* I compete on Kaggle. When I start a competition, I usually look for solutions to similar problems to help me get started.  E.g. if the objective is to minimize RMSLE (root mean squared log error) I like to look for code samples which also minimize RMSLE.  If the problem involves classifying an unbalanced target, I like to see how other people dealt with this. MLPB was designed to make it easy for me (and hopefully others) to search for problems and solutions with specific characteristics like this.

* A single problem should (ideally) contain a bunch of sample solutions, so you can compare scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier to R's randomForest to XGBoost (in Python or R).

* Hopefully having a standardized format for sample problems and sample solutions should make it really easy to get up and running with a new model or language you want to learn. Lately I've been learning XGBoost and I feel like finding the right blog/article/snippet of documentation related to what I want to do is half the battle.

- The contractors always have a Ph.D. overseeing the process

- Managers know nothing about data and think that machine learning and statistics are going to end world hunger (an exaggeration, but given how outsiders sell their expertise, it doesn't seem farfetched)

- The managers hire an analyst to help with the process in some way

- When something goes extremely wrong, the contractors blame it on something like ""noise"" in the data.

"With so many options of math textbooks available based just on similar Reddit topics, it might get fairly complicated to stick with 2-3 textbooks on:

 - Calculus
 - Linear algebra
 - Probability
 - Statistics (these two might be combined)
 - Optimization
 - Numerical methods

Let's follow the following format: everyone suggests only textbooks that he or she personally read and found helpful. Ideally, a brief explanation of why you find this book superior would be great. 

Some more parameters:

 - Suggested books don't have to target specifically at math used in data science (have the ""data science"" in their titles).

 - If possible, books are the preferred format. There's no doubt that there are plenty of outstanding courses, but I have always been better at learning from texts.

 - There is no limitation on whether the book should be open source or not. That said, high-quality and free resources are a perfect combination. 

 - For some reason, shiny magazine-like textbooks don't work for me (and probably for others). 
""The Cartoon Guide to Statistics"" is often recommended, for example, but I find it very hard to read and can't even treat is seriously as a learning resource.

 - I totally can't stand textbooks where the author addresses his readers as if those were toddlers (or idiots) by all means avoiding anything challenging. 

 - The reader has a thorough grasp of basic algebra, as well as everything covered in a typical precalculus course

NOTE:

You can ignore all the parameters outlined above if you think that your suggestion is really good.  

Why do I need this?

I am often told that I should consult with a specialist, but I get totally paralyzed when there are too many options from which to choose. The same applies to my data science learning plan. Having received detailed recommendations on the best data science learning resources, I have managed to create a well-structured learning plan for data science (at least, the essentials). 
Yet, every time I encounter a data science article or post I understand that my broad but shallow knowledge of mathematics is a limiting factor. I am ready to put a lot of effort to build the necessary foundation in math: primarily in linear algebra and statistics. 

Eventually, I believe that we could create a structured learning plan for math used in data science and machine learning based on the discussion here. The question comes up increasingly often on Reddit.

"I always hear people telling me R has a higher learning curve. That's pretty much a signature statement for them. But python is much, much more complex. They have lists, data frames, arrays, tuples, dictionaries, LISTS of dictionaries, and I'm probably missing a bunch of other forms of storing data. For R, it's almost dumbfounding how straightforward it is. You have vectors, and you can still create dataframes. Also, you have the tidyverse, which makes working with data easier than a day at the golf course. 


Much of Python's packages are dramatically more complex as well. Take web scraping. You have to use beautifulsoup/bs4, and then you have to import lxml, and then you parse it with some arbitrarily complex code. On R, you just read_HTML, use rvest to read it in, and you're set. You can literally [scrape a page in R in less than 6 lines! ](https://youtu.be/gSbuwYdNYLM?t=166) They pull an entire table from Calpoly's admissions site, in SIX LINES! [The same operation in Python is quite arbitrary and is a frivolous venture](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/). Look how long this freaking tutorial is, just to scrape the simplest page! What is worse about this example is that rvest will look for ALL tables, in the entire page, and then you just specify what you want. But for python, you have to use a ridiculous for loop to loop over every single table you want. This pretty little example makes it seem like you're going to have a gleaming and wonderful output, which really isn't the case. 

Here is some code for a 'simple' webscraping script for Python I found on the web on the suggestion of an expert Python programmer: 

#########################
from urllib.request import urlopen, Request


from urllib.parse import urlencode



from bs4 import BeautifulSoup



url = 'https://opir.fiu.edu/instructor_evals/instr_eval_result.asp'



data = {'Term':'1171', 'Coll':'%', 'Dept':'','RefNum':'','Crse':'','Instr':''}



r = urlopen(Request(url, data=urlencode(data).encode()))



html = r.read().decode()




soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')




tables = soup.find_all('table')
#########################



Yes, this is SO much simpler than R, especially to a novice who has barely ever programmed (/s)! Plus, the code doesn't work, and results in a nasty error: 


**'UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe9 in position 5779573: invalid continuation byte'**


Do you really think a novice is going to understand what this is, or how to solve this issue? 



In addition, installing packages or libraries in Python as a beginner is downright infuriating. After installing Python, you have to literally MAP pip to your environment variables on your PC. This took me several hours working on an older machine (I have no control over the OS used on some of the machines I work on), as it wasn't easy to locate, and even when I found it, it simply wouldn't accept the directory without extensive troubleshooting. The alternative isyou can download Anaconda/miniconda, but then, depending on your IDE, you have to go into your settings and choose which interpreter to use... The default, or the anaconda. 

In R, guess what you do? Go to packages, click install, type the package, done. Then you click the checkbox to enable it. No interpreters, no editing environment variables, or spending hours fussing over errors you get with Python. Anyone got wonna dem Staples EASY buttons ?


tl;dr: Everything is more complex in Python. R is the boogeyman to those who haven't put the slightest effort into learning it, but Python involves doing far more work for the same result, with much more frustration **if you are a novice**. I have no doubt that in eight years, after working with Python for years, that I will have a sufficient grasp on it. But as a novice, Python has a lot more to learn than R does. I'm not saying Python is a horrible language, but I am saying that it most certainly isn't as novice/user friendly as it claims, and it's a bit harsh that the data community makes R look like the boogeyman when in reality, it's the friendly neighbor willing to help.

"http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/16-reasons-data-scientists-are-difficult-to-manage

There are so many things wrong with this blog post, I barely know where to start, but that's never stopped me before. Let's break this down a bit, shall we?

*Data scientists are creative and bring disruptive IP (intellectual property), and this can cause havoc for their company*


That's why I hired them.


*They can steal and leverage your IP, and create IP leaks.*


Which is why companies have a general counsel.


*Are not great communicators, and sometimes can be stubborn*


So you hired cats?


*Work on stuff that they like, even if it does not translate in yield, or if it is not stuff they are paid to do*


No managers on staff?


*Hate doing mundane work, and are bad at it*


They are way too expensive to have them doing mundane work anyway. Hire cheaper people for that.


*Have more career options than many employees, and are thus difficult to retain*


Pay them appropriately, challenge them often, and manage them well.


*Don't like team work,*


Mine are brilliant at team work. Perhaps hire better?


*Tend to be elitist and isolationist*


Hire better.


*Are sometimes very attached to a specific technology and don't want to try something different (they sometimes give the impression that they haven't realized the world is evolving without them)*


Are you sure you hired data scientists?


*Are not good listeners*


Seriously? Most of the ones I run across are some of the most thoughtful listeners I've ever worked with. That's how they learn from each other.


*Work for you just to save enough money to launch their company and compete with you in a couple of years*


Then my company needs an ass-kicking. If they aren't going to do it, our competitors sure as hell will.


*Are arrogant: bad impact on teams*


I'd rephrase this as ""Are smart: should probably be listened to""


*Think sales, marketing and executives are stupid*


Ummm (just kidding). If they ignore the science and go with their gut ""just because"", I'd argue that they are.


*Can do real nasty stuff if they become a disgruntled employee*


I hope you don't have any DBAs on staff then, or you're screwed. 


*Are sometimes reluctant to share their knowledge, train colleagues, or outsource to colleagues*


While some of the points have a small whiff of truth at times, I have never ever ever experienced this.


*Are not great at prioritizing*


This one is actually pretty true in some cases. This is why you hire managers.


*Are not great at switching (on-demand) from one task (coding) to another (presenting)*


I think it's more a matter of some not being able to present well to a broader audience. This is eminently trainable in almost all cases.


*Sometimes have issues working with women (especially managing or being managed by women), especially if coming from a male-dominant culture*


One third of my team are women (I'd be fine if it were higher), so I don't see this in practice.


I'm sure that there are some data scientists for which some of the above might be true. Given that, at-will employment is pretty much the default these days, so it's just not that hard to fire their ass and replace them with one of the many excellent data scientists in the world. I think the blogger's beef should be with bad managers instead.","Bad Data Scientist, no donut",69u6m3,top,16.0,57.0,57.0,0.0
"I recently attended a data science competition and as expected, I didn't perform well, but I'm eager to improve and perform better at the next one.

To shed light on where I am now - I've been able to gain a little bit of theoretical ML knowledge from my university introductory ML course that covers everything from supervised learning to game theory. I'm familiar with applying off-the-shelf ML algorithms and have gotten my feet wet with data wangling and messy datasets. 

My question is this - how do I go beyond from where I am now and improve as an aspiring data scientist? Most guides, FAQ, and articles I've been encountering are ways to dive into data science but they don't expound on how to go beyond it. I plan on picking up a prob/stat minor along with my undergraduate CS degree, pick up a copy of [ISL](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), begin doing Kaggle competition.

"Not sure where else to post this, so I thought it was worth a shot.

I have a master's degree in a quantitative field. My graduate work focused mostly on statistical research using various regression techniques including programming several different models by hand (rather than regression functions like in Excel) and running them using different data sets.

I always envisioned ending up in something like a data scientist role, but after grad school, I don't know that I'm intelligent enough for a career using super in-depth statistics without a professor there to consult with. I ended up in a data analyst role which is less about statistics and more about combing through data for trends and using summary statistics. When I started, I really enjoyed the work because I my job included programming and writing reports. I also felt like the work I was doing was contributing to something useful.

My work at the company has changed somewhat of late, and I also don't find myself enjoying the work as much as I used to - not sure if it's boredom, cynicism, or just apathy. I can't wait for the day to be over, and I've been in a general sour mood.

I guess I'm curious about the experiences of other current/former data analysts. I'm wary of trying to find a new job because I make decent money and the culture at my work is fantastic. I worry about making a change and ending up somewhere with douchey management or coworkers.

"I am over half way through my Master's in Data Science and Business Analytics, and due to my non-computing background (BSc Financial Economics), I have basically been doing just enough to pass the courseworks. Other than learning some R (a bit of modelling, a bit of machine learning, some sentiment analysis and data visualisation), some MS SQL in Visual Studio and lastly a tiny bit of C# (but I didn't learn much nor do I want to learn C#). Despite being decent in statistics, I don't feel like I've actually learnt anywhere near enough to get a job in this field, particularly because I'm still not proficient in a single language. It's partly my fault, and partly the fault of the modules spreading themselves too thin. 

The remaining modules are in finance (the 'business analytics' side of the course). I have this summer to complete my dissertation (I'm examining the benefits of using sentiment analysis to inform investment in the stock market).

I'm clearly not going to land a job in data science, so my questions are three-fold:

1) What are some good side-projects/online courses I could do along side my dissertation this summer to actually earn my title of having a Master's in Data Science, and thus to help me land a job?

2) Should I do my dissertation in Python rather than R, in order to begin to learn what seems like a more wide-used language?

3) What job-titles can I search for in the job market that require less programming experience in analytics/data science, or perhaps analytical jobs that will welcome my strong background in finance?","Over half way through my MSc Data Science but feel like I haven't learnt anywhere near enough.

"Hey all,

I have an interview with Fb for their DS, Analytics role and my first phone screen interview is next week. I know that it has a 50-50 Tech(SQL/Python/R) - Analytics split. I have been practising numerous SQL questions specifically for interview but finding those kind of questions are a bit tough and I was hoping people who have gone through the process or are familiar can post their experience with the type of questions or put sample questions for me to continue working on. I'm not asking to reveal any NDA material, just helpful questions more like an anonymous mentors on reddit. I feel that my SQL concepts are strong but maybe due to less interview experience I trip up during product based SQL questions or am a bit slow, hence I just want more such material to keep practising on. I have compiled whatever questions I could from Glassdoor so am hoping you guys can be of help!

"First of all, I want to assure you that I have done my homework and read a large number of similar ""I wanna be a data scientist. But how?"" topics. This is where I found about numerous resources and books that can be used to study the field. Even though now I have an exhaustive list of resources, I would also like to prioritize them and outline a sequence in which to learn the materials. In addition, some fragments of my plan might be totally wrong or inaccurate, so I would appreciate any kind of advice and recommendations. 

I. Learning Python (since I already have some experience in Python programming, I have decided to stick Python. I'm not even an intermediate Python programmer yet, but I try to learn things on the go. The Python tutorial is of great help.

-- Sometimes I also look through Python Cookbook and Fluent Python to get at least moderately familiar with the best practices for pythonistas. 

Questions:

1. Is it reasonable to stick with just Python? Or should I also get familiar with R?

2. Is it enough to be moderately fluent in Python without knowing the ins and outs?

II. Learning the math

I have a basic command of calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics. Yet, I'm afraid that my knowledge is rather fragmented and I should seriously brush up on linear algebra and statistics. 
There are so many books on the subjects. I have chosen the following:

 - Strang's Introduction to Linear Algebra
 - OpenIntro Statistics
 - Probability by Ross to review the basics
 - ISLR (not exactly a textbook to learn statistics, but a very good source of information for the applications)

Questions:

1. Are the sources outlined above exhaustive enough to cover the fundamentals of the math necessary for learning data science and machine learning and understand the algorithms and methods used?

III. The basics of data science

I have come to the conclusion that it could be useful to read a less technical book on what data science deals with first. Not that I have no idea yet - I have been interested in data science and machine learning for a while and read about it on a regular basis. It's just that now I'm trying to get serious about it and make the learning process more structured and organized. 

-- Field Cady - The Data Science Handbook

This is the book I'm considering to be a source of general knowledge and understanding of the field. 

IV. Data Science using Python

This is the most problematic section because there are plenty of well-rated books, and I don't quite understand how much they overlap in coverage.

 - Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas
 - Python for Data Analysis - Wes McKinney
 - Data Science from Scratch - Joel Grus

V. Machine learning

Almost the same situation here, although there are fewer contestants:) 

 - Python Machine Learning by S. Raschka
 - Hands-on machine learning by Aurelien Geron 

General questions:

1. Is there anything I am missing?

2. How much do the books I mentioned above overlap? Is there any use in reading all of them?

3. Are there any other great books that are not included on the lists?

4. There are some popular courses on data science and machine learning. Unfortunately, I learn much better from textbooks than from video courses. Can the books replace those?

5. It might also be the case that the order that I suggested is not optimal. What do you think about it?

"Hello All, 

I have recently started teaching myself R and Python since I have always been enamored with data, I have always wanted to tell stories using it. Now I see that there are a ton of articles here about Data Science and how to become a DS, but I want to take it a step further and actually create a self taught community that can put the ""how to"" into action.

Naturally, I started a blog and Facebook page to chart my lessons and to challenge myself to put my classes to use, and I realized that the best way for me to learn was helping others learn the same material, and I want to bring that same mentality to others. I'll also be posting topics, lessons from others that I find, and generally anything that can help anyone get into the field.

The question may sound stupid (or it actually is, help me) but the reason why I am asking this is because I feel that as a medium experienced software developer it would be somehow _easy_ to ""just have the right idea"" and mock a prototype software/web app/mobile app to showcase to investors.

On the other side I see data science as a key department in medium/big companies but I find it difficult to think of a medium experienced data scientist starting off his company by, at least initially, leveraging only his own skills. I'd rather think of a senior data scientist running a company based on some cutting edge technology.

I hope this all makes sense. I'm just trying to balance my current desire to get into data science with what I think would be my _ultimate goal_ of running my own small company.

I would love to hear your feedback. Oh and if it makes any difference, I'm 28.

I, of course, passed their SQL test, but before I start the job, I would like to really be advanced in SQL. I've taken several Udemy and Lynda courses, so I understand SQL itself fairly well.

What I would want is actually try SQL queries on different databases - basically to have tasks to find something in a particular database (or different databases), but I don't seem to be able to find anything with Google.

I do have the 3 basic databases (Northwind, WideWorld and Adventureworks) from Microsoft restored in my SQL server, and they do have a lot of data, but I have no idea what to try and find to test my abilities. Do you know of any such sites?

"Downloading data from an API is a really common process. Here is how I normally deal with it, and I'm looking for other best practices or resources or other ways of doing it that are better. 

1. Write functions that interface with the API, download the data, and return the data in a dataframe-like object. Allow function to accept command line arguments with an option to rebuild the database (re-download everything) or just download the latest data. 

2. Use a small Amazon EC2 instance and schedule the data download using bash scripts and cron jobs. 

3. Save the data to Amazon RDS. 

4. Set up logging and a Slackbot that scans the logs for errors using regex also using cron jobs and generates notifications in Slack if necessary.

1. Is this a good process? 

2. What technologies or tools am I missing that could make this better?

"Hello all,

Back in June, I started as an entry-level data analyst on a medium-sized analytics team. I'm curious to hear what advice you have for someone in their first year out of college.

A little about me: I work mostly in R and am a solid R programmer (I work 95% in the Tidyverse and routinely write my own functions to automate routine data munging). I also have a solid background in Python, SQL, Tableau.

A little about my team: The team has a few data scientists and a number of data analysts. It is part of a medium-sized company.

Here are a few areas that I have been thinking about targeting for my personal growth over the next 3 - 6 months. Any thoughts or advice on how to improve in these areas? Any new areas I should look at?

1. Technical Skills: I am confident in my data-munging/data visualization skills. I think the next big tool to add to my toolkit is predictive modeling/machine learning. Anything else I should look into?

2. Project Management: I still struggle with appropriately scoping analyses. I often want to dive into a larger/more interesting/more accurate analysis instead of one that has limitations but that gets the job done. Right now, I tend to present my manager with my ""dream"" option and my idea of a ""scoped"" version and let her decide between the two.

3. Identifying New Projects: There are lots of areas for improvement in the company which is exciting but also daunting.

"Hello,

I am hoping for a thorough critique of my resume to prepare for data scientist roles. A little more about me, I have a degree in Biomedical Science with experience in mainly life science-based data analysis except for my most recent role which is in finance/aviation. I have been programming for about 2 years in python, advanced in SQL and relational databases, and just beginning in R. I am taking the MIT MicroMaster degree in Stats and Data Science as a stepping stone to returning to school and hopefully fill in some missing gaps of knowledge of machine learning and statistics. In my current role I am able to freely use ML and have implemented a random forest and k-means algorithm with real data.

Ultimately, my main goal is to transition from data analysis to data science, although I am able to use DS techniques in my current role my main responsibilities are still data analysis oriented. 

P.S. My dream job is as a data scientist/python developer at NASA (I have been taking courses and reading text on astrophysics/cosmology) so any specifics on anything that would help with that would be great, but is not necessary.

"I am currently a data scientist, which was a mid\-career change for me. Recently I have been going through the interview process and I have noticed some behavior that is becoming more common.  In interviews I have been subjected to questions about my past experience before I was a  data scientist. Trying to build a timeline to get closer to my “real” age. Some recruiters even cheerfully tell me that they are looking for “good young people” like me. Which is something I usually just shrug off, but seems to bother me more now. I also have noticed positions being filled by those with advanced degrees from brand name schools; the general bar seems higher than it was just a few years ago. I have an advanced degree, but what seemed interesting was the influx of overseas students with these degrees filling these positions. The issue with this is that these students cannot receive financial aid; therefore I was wondering how the socioeconomic background of hires and candidates has changed over time. This issue concerns me because of you have ever read Lauren Rivera's book ""Prestige: How Elite Students Get Elite Jobs,"" you would now how important the issue of pedigree is in the finance and consulting world. I am wondering if data science is going down this path.

Currently I am looking for an entry level data scientist / data analyst full time job around East coast, USA.

I know how to handle R, Python, and SQL which are know as the three most required tools. And here my qurstion arise: how proficient do companies expect from just-got-out-of-college-student?

I was told that once you get hired, the company is going to train you at least 3 months because what you've learned from college is not cutting edge or ready to be used stuffs. In that sense, I kinda thought ""then perhaps companies would take something else than technical skills into account when they are hiring for entry level job.""

"I was diving into searching for ETL and I'll be honest, I feel like it's just a ton of technobabble. First, no one can explain what ETL is. I understand what it physically is, data migration, but I don't understand why it needs to be a ""skill"". It seems to be more of a ""task"". Second, I can't find a single framework that doesn't seem to be more than a way to injest SQL scripts and run them on the database, so why do I need said framework anyways when I can just code this myself? Third, why does every single article I see seem like a sales pitch on another dependency? I don't really think I need Hive, Pig, and 10 other Apache tools to migrate data.

What do you actually use for ETL, and what are your thoughts in terms of whether this is actually a skill one should learn? Granted, I'm more of a software engineer, so for us, we call this ""database migrations"" and we just use a programming language with a database access library. We actually can set up a local store with a few samples from the database, and then run this script on that to test the migration. It's never been an issue. I'm just not sold on these ETL tools since you still can't beat the CAP theorem. You either run your migration on live data to keep it consistent, or you shut down your entire database and apply your migration.

I have been tasked with designing a plan for a Data Science/Analytics focused major within a business school.  I realize the consensus on this sub seems to be to do CS/Stats as an undergrad major, but we have a large demand for a data focused major (Data Science/Data Analytics) major within the business school and that is the task I have been given.

I have collected a lot of information from other BS, BA, BBA programs, but I want to get some input from practitioners. Where else do you find experts who are passionate about a subject but Reddit?

(If this is against the rules please let me know and I will try to gather information other places.)

Any feedback you can give me will be helpful, however we have a great deal of flexibility in terms of designing new courses or using courses from across our campus so what I would like to hear from those of you out there in the trenches is what topics and or skills you think a freshly minted business major looking for a job in Data Science should have.

\*A little background that may focus the conversation:\*To avoid ""overfitting"" or producing a ""flash in the pan"" major we are creating the program as a track within our existing BS in Economics (not a BBA). So you can assume they will have covered: Calculus 1, basic probability, mathematical calculus based Micro and Macro Theory, introductory applied Econometrics (OLS, Logit, Probit with R). Also we project that \~50% of the students will also be double majors with CS, Math, Stats or Finance.

​

Let me provide a template that you should feel free to completely ignore :)

**Your background:**

Examples: Currently learning, Working as Data Scientist, Hirer of Data Scientist, Trainer, Professor etc... If it is in your flair then skip this one.

​

**Conceptual Topics that MUST be covered:**

Topics and techniques that everyone doing Data Science in a business setting should have. Possible examples:  Regression, Machine Learning?

​

**Conceptual Topics that WOULD BE NICE  to cover:**

Topics and techniques that would be nice to see, but are not deal breakers. Possible Examples: Linear Algebra, Hierarchical Models, Bayesian MLE, Frequentists MLS, Non-Parametic Estimation, Distributed Systems, MCMC?

​

**Practical Skills that MUST be covered**:Skills and tools that everyone doing Data Science in a business setting should have. Possible examples: R or Python/Pandas, Data Mining/Cleaning, SQL?

​

**Practical Skills that WOULD BE NICE  to cover:**

Skills and tools that would be nice to see but are not deal breakers. Possible examples: Hadoop, Spark, Matlab/NumPy?

​

**What would the ideal internship look like?**

We will be requiring internships and we want them to provide real signaling to potential employers.

"Hey all,

As per one user's great advice from [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6x3z1y/aspiring_data_scientist_with_a_background_in/) about two weeks ago, I began my journey into ML and data science. I completed Andrew Ng's course on ML and found it extremely interesting. I loved every bit of it. I was on coursera every day, and completed everything in that course. It was very cool to go on Kaggle, read some tutorial kernals, and just find myself noting what the provider should have done differently as per Prof. Ng's advice. I feel like I have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of some of the most basic and widely used ML algorithms today, and how to use them properly. 

I'd now like to contribute on Kaggle, but I really do not have the skills to do ML (or really any data science) in Python/R. Though I probably could mash up some code from some popular kernals, I really wouldn't know what I was doing, and so that would be pointless. I've discovered two courses (specializations) that focus [on deep learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning#pricing) / [general data science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python#pricing) using Python, that seem pretty good. At this point, I'd like to learn Python over R.

Has anyone taken these courses? Does anyone have an opinion on what are some good ways to learn Python with data science? Sometimes I think I could be overcomplicating this, but I really don't think it's wise to jump into Kaggle, only to possibly burn myself out because I don't know Python. Perhaps someone has been in a similar situation and can help guide me? Again, I could just jump into the above two courses, but if anyone can help optimize my solution so that I start in a better direction, that would be huge! 

Thanks you, everyone! As it stands, my game plan is to get on Kaggle, build up a portfolio, and use that to help me land a job in the ML realm. I've actually found some interesting jobs that combine both my collegiate background with ML. Pretty neat.

"Hi all,

The past three months I've been interviewing for data scientist positions and I thought I would share my results since posts like this have been popular in the past.

##Background:
I am finishing up a mathematics PhD. Around the time I was finishing my thesis (in algebraic geometry, completely pure math), about a year ago, I decided to focus entirely on a career in industry, and have been taking advantage of my student status taking graduate CS and stats courses at my university in preparation, as well as taking an ML internship this past summer.

Thus, I'm fairly similar to what seems like a large contingent in this sub: technical background trying to break into data science. Fortunately I had some programming experience already to make this an easier transition.

My resume reads something like:  
Education:  
PhD Mathematics, Decent University  
Additional coursework in Statistics and Computer Science  
BS Mathematics, minor Physics, Less Decent University  

Experience:  
Mathematics TA/Instructor, 5 years

Researcher, Government Lab, 3 months (last summer)  
Applying stats/ML to large data sets using Python, R, C++, SQL

Programmer, Government Lab, 8 months (during undergrad)  
Writing GUIs for controlling a large scientific measurement device, in C

Programmer, Government Lab, 6 months (during undergrad)  
Using unsupervised learning to analyze medical data, in C

Languages/tools: Python, R, C++, C, SQL, D3.js, Tableau, CUDA, Matlab

## Process
This past September I began applying, telling companies I could graduate in December as long as I heard back before November 30th and could my defense set up and such. I intended to continue at my university for another quarter if I didn't find anything.

In general the process is thus: first, a phone call with the recruiter talking generally about the position, my background, and gauging my interest.

Next, 1-3 technical screens, half focusing on programming and the other half on data science.

The programming half is on something like collabedit, and generally has a few questions for you to code up in python. These range from ""merge two sorted lists"" and ""compute the fibonacci numbers"" to ""write a routine to preprocess text files, code to train a naive bayes classifier, and predict using that code (not call a library, write the whole thing)"". I recommend checking out a site like HackerRank (for the problems, not the contests), which have a range of problem difficulties. Practice talking through your thought process too.

The data science half has some basic stats questions and generally talking through how you would solve a ML problem from start to finish. For instance, one time I had to talk through how I would set up Zillow's Zestimate from what data I would use, what model, how I would train it over a large set, verify results, keep it updated, diagnose problems, etc.

Then there's the on-site, which is similar to the screens above but more focused on the actual company and role, more difficult, and much longer.

## The Numbers

I ended up applying to 39 companies, all in the Seattle area (part of my motivation for industry was that I could stay in Seattle). Of those, I got interest from 11, but only 7 were willing to get through the process before my deadline. Of those, I withdrew my application after the first screen for 1, was rejected after a screen for a second, withdrew before the scheduled on-site for another, and thus had 4 on-site interviews.

For one, they initially accepted while saying they would provide a 6 week training program since my background wasn't strong enough. Eventually they reneged and said to hold off for a few months. I had concerns for the work/life balance there, so this didn't worry me that much.

For another, I was rejected after the on-site. Oh well.

The last two I got offers from, and decided to take one.

I've anonymized the companies and uniformized the job titles somewhat (there are many equivalent titles to data scientist (quantitative analyst, machine learning scientist, statistical analyst, research engineer...)), but the dates and offers are real. SDE = any software role, DS = data scientist or equivalent, RS = research scientist (large overlap with DS but sometimes focused on a particular topic like NLP or computer vision).

a couple of months ago I [asked /dataanalyst](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/6sffln/i_want_to_become_a_data_analyst_help_me_find_my/) for orientation on how to become a data scientist. Since then, I have:

1. Learned R
2. Done a Data Science Specialization on Coursera
3. Done [sqlzoo](https:sqlzoo.net) and [codeacademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql) tutorials
4. Created a [portfolio](https://github.com/danilodaraujo/PORTFOLIO-DS) (so far, 1 NLP and Data cleaning project)

&nbsp;

The thing is that **SQL seems to heavily be required** by a lot of job opportunities. So I would like to show my SQL skills by tackling a ""real life"" problem SQL project on my portfolio.

&nbsp;

But, to be able to do that, I need your help with a few questions:

**1. Why SQL is so important for data science?**

**2. What sort of tool should I use?** Don't get me wrong, I loved sqlzoo's tutorial. But they only teach how to use queries. Apart from the *sqldf* package on R, I don't have any tools to work with SQL. Which is the most common used?

**3. Finally, what kind of projects would you recommend?** I want to pick something that shows that I may not be a specialist in SQL, but I know what is important or necessary. For instance, would you recommend a data cleaning project with SQL? Is usual in the market?

"Hi everyone,

How do you manage your projects in a corporate setting where multiple folks collaborate on a single project?  

Where are current doing ""a folder per project"" on a network drive. There, you find the following subfolders :   
  
- a ""data/raw"" subfolder, where we put the raw data, shapefile, etc..  
- a  ""git"" folder for each collaborator  (git-username1, git-username2, etc..)  to clone the repo and work on the code.  That subfolder is built similar to [cookiecutter data science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).    The main difference is that we don't put the raw data there, because we don't want to create a copy of the data for each collaborator and we don't want to check it into git.   When we need to refer to the data, we'll refer to ""/../data/raw/""  

there are also some extra folders such as  

- ""mandate"" , where we put what is the goal of this project, who asked for it, what is the delivery date, etc..
- ""litterature"" where we put pdfs from relevant book chapters, articles, blog posts, etc..

This works fine as long as the project is ""on going"".  When we will be done, we will delete all the ""git"" folders and simply leave a URL shortcut to the git repo so that someone can clone the latest version when needed.

If someone needs to take over the project a year from now, they will need two separate places:  
a) git repo for the code  
b) data/raw folder  
  
I feel the code is safe on the internal git repo, but I'm  afraid for the data.  A well intentioned person could move or delete the data folder.    Worse, someone could edit the data without meaning to do it (I'm looking at you excel).  

Also, it is kind of an hassle while sharing projects between teams because we will have to ask IT to provide access to two different places (git AND data) instead of just one.

How do folks do it?  The datascience cookiecutter mentions the following:   
  
- AWS S3 with a syncing tool
- Git large file storage
- Git annex
- Dat

This is corporate data, so we don't want to put it just anywhere. 

thanks

1. Are the job responsibilities too vague?
2. What type of data scientists should we be looking for? Would hiring a PhD candidate make a huge difference? Or would candidates with less experience but more passion for the cryptoassets industry be a viable option?
3. Obviously, candidates would need to have experience with financial valuation models, but we also want them to be flexible in finding interesting bits of data, whether anomalies in valuations or correlations between price and other data that we're collecting (social media presence, number of followers, number of active developers and git commits), sentiment analysis, etc.). Is this too much to ask for? From my understanding, data scientists are often experienced in one or a couple of specialties (Statistician / Mathematician / Machine Learning Scientists / Actuarial Scientist). Please correct me if I'm wrong.
4. Are data scientists who we should be even looking for? If so, what type of experience should I be looking for in their resumes for the duties that are laid out in the job listing?

They're looking for:

* 2+ years of experience analyzing data to solve business and technical problems 
* Experience in Python is a plus
* Familiarity with SQL
* Advanced experience in Tableau
* Experience in network-monitoring software is a plus

What's confusing me is that they want someone with experience, but only need some familiarity with SQL and Python experience *is a plus?* I was under the assumption that those skills were pretty necessary for someone working in Data Analysis, right? I don't understand how someone with experience as a DA doesn't have fairly robust knowledge of Python and SQL. Does this sound like a entry-level position? Maybe it was written by HR and the desired skill-set wasn't properly communicated to him/her.

"**Meta Discussion**

There has been talk for a while about having a sidebar FAQ for a lot of the common/repeated questions we get on this subreddit, but nobody has actually put anything together (that I have seen).

I would be willing to do some of the legwork on this, but **I wanted to see what kinds of questions/content people think should go into such a FAQ before I get started.**

Bonus points if you can post examples from the subreddit.

**EDIT: I'm going to take a swing at a few of these to get something on paper.  My plan is to search the subreddit history for posts relating to these topics and try to distill them down.**

"Hi there,

I'm a 27 year old male form the UK looking for a complete change of career into data science/statistics. 

Basically I need to get some qualifications. There is a suitable 'conversion course' of sorts in data science. The alternative is to basically go down a lengthy process of an undergraduate degree in stats and then a postgraduate in stats. It would take me half the amount of time and be considerably cheaper if I was to go down the data science route.

My only concern is that I wouldn't be as qualified if I did the conversion course rather than the stats course. 

Basically my question is what are the main differences between data science and stats? The differences seem to be pretty unclear from what I've read. Are statisticians generally more qualified than data scientists, can they command a higher wage etc?

"I heard that a data scientist job could vary a lot by company. I would just like to confirm if what I heard is true and if anyone could provide further insights.

Besides the roles which are essentially the same as data analysts or data engineers, my friend, who is a data scientist, told me there are two types: application data scientists and research data scientists.

He says the application type DS does modeling to solve a business need and only uses tools which are already developed. There are not a whole lot of models \(he uses xgboost, random forests, neural nets, glm, etc.\) to choose from/play around with besides just tuning parameters. He says it gets boring fast and already learned pretty much all he can within 2 years.

He says the research DS are the ones who do the most interesting cutting\-edge work \(e.g. nlp, ai, voice recognition, self\-driving cars, deep learning\) and creating new algorithms. This is the interesting and high paying DS work that most people want.

He also claims the following increasing order of pay, interesting work, and difficulty:

Application DS \< Software Engineer \< Research DS.

My impression was that the application DS is what most data scientists are and it is interesting, creative work. The research DS job is ML/DL/AI research, requires a phd, and are more like researchers than actual data scientists.

Could anyone verify how much of what he says is true?

Does application DS really get boring after awhile?

Is the pay comparison among the 3 jobs correct on average?

Is there really such a divide in DS and if so, is it difficult to switch from applications to research w/o phd after a few years of experience?",Types of Data Scientist Jobs?,8e241u,top,22.0,38.0,38.0,0.0

"Hello,

Having been a loyal, albeit predominantly lurking, member of this sub for some time now. I often see the frustration (on both ends) from people looking to become employable as Data Scientists and those in the industry sick of answering the same questions.


#


Something I was really hoping to get into was a bit of branch from the commonality of these posts and more towards: “I honestly feel like I am employable/can bring value to a company, however, I can’t even get my resume through the door because I do not have a degree.”


#


For context:  I have been a freelance python developer for going on a decade now, I have competed in many data science challenges (even won a few), participated and won more than a few hackathon/coding challenges, and have gone through just about every noteworthy MOOC I have found.  This is by no means an exhaustive list of all the things I’ve compiled in my pursuit of employment – but I thought it was a good start.   That said, I have unfortunately never actually held a position which has labeled me as a ‘developer’ or anything which would seem remotely applicable on a resume when applying to a data science firm or company looking to employ someone for ______ (insert something about data).  I also hold no higher education degree.
I have carefully read many posts here which say you need to “be able to tell a story with your work,” and “demonstrate your thirst and ability to wrangle data.”  I also have a pretty decent portfolio designed to hit many of the points this sub has deemed worth showing off.


The catalyst for my current frustration (and this post if I’m being honest) came a few weeks ago when I was presenting my findings at the end of a local event and was approached by a lead data scientist, who was judging this particular competition, who went on to say something like:


“You seem to have a better understanding of neural networks than most of my data scientists and the way you designed your process was pretty innovative.  Are you looking for a job, by chance?”


Me: “I would love to come down for an interview”


Him: “Great!  So, where did you get your degree from?”

Me: “Well, I dropped out of college my sophomore year but {here’s some of things I’ve done to demonstrate my passion and pursuit of this trade – see above}”


Him: “Oh, ok…well, let me get your information and I’ll get back to you”


Me: “Well let me get you my gitlab and I can send you some ideas and demonstrations I have as well – “


Him: “Yeah, I’ll have someone from recruiting email you sometime in the future.”


I would like to clarify that I *completely* understand that I could not possibly have the theoretical foundation that someone with a PhD in stats or mathematics could have, however, I honestly believe I continue to demonstrate that I have a real passion for this work – and a fairly respectable aptitude for it.  I am also in no way trying to say that I can do the same job as someone with a PhD, or take anything away from their value.


From my perspective, this field seems to have a mindset much like software development used to be notorious for: “no degree – no job,” even though it was fairly obvious that someone could learn to code to some functional level, completely on their own (again, I completely understand the hate for code bootcamp grads vs. college grads, etc). 
 

I have to wonder if those of us who have been participating in data science as a hobby via Kaggle, Numerai, DataDriven, local events, etc – have even the smallest shot of making enough noise to get an employer’s attention (outside flat-out crushing multiple kaggle comps and creating a startup).


I have to imagine that there is a role for someone like me, even if it’s just to work with the folks with the strong theoretical backgrounds to quickly develop prototypes then fine tune – or something to that effect.  I have submitted somewhere in the region of 200 resumes, and only ever sat two interviews (which I thought and was told went very well) only to be stiff-armed by their HR departments.


I was hoping I could get some input from this sub – as, even through the smattering of reposts, someone always seems to take the time to reiterate (nicely) or provide some valuable insight to OP.  I do apologize if this particular topic has either been covered or beaten to death, but my search results didn’t bring up much.


I appreciate any thoughts or insight you guys have and look forward to hearing from you.

for me:

bnlearn - belief networks

np - nonparametric regression (slow as hell)

gam - generalized additive models

I currently work at a software services company, and struggle somewhat with experimentation concepts.

* Good approach to making hypotheses and designing experiments
* Guidelines for logging exposures so that the data is valid and imbalanced exposures don't happen

"Data Science Training Programs

 With data scientists in high demand, lots of training programs have started up to help people learn the skills necessary to enter the profession. I’m guessing many of you may have made a New Year’s resolution to learn/improve your data science skills, and thought a post identifying the numerous programs would be helpful. I spent a fair amount of time in 2017 researching the various data science training programs available and have categorized these programs by price, payment structure (flat fee, subscription, per class), and curriculum (structured vs ala carte). Please keep in mind I am not ranking these training programs, just categorizing them.

Data Science Training Programs

Gateway Drugs: Free, ala Carte Courses
These programs allow you to select and take free data science courses. Kaggle’s kernels are very useful for picking up specific data science skills, whereas Data 36 provides more generalized courses. Both provide an easy way to get a basic familiarization with data science skills and Kaggle is great for picking up specific skills. Udacity actually uses their courses as a gateway to their paid nanodegree programs and you can take quite a bit of the content for free.

Enter the Dojo: Free Training Programs with Structured Curriculum
Two variations of the free program with structured curriculum are available. The first I’ll cover is general introduction to data science programs. These include Allison, Future Learn, edX, and Cognitive Class. All provide a structured sequence of courses you can take to learn various aspects of statistical analysis programming. Future Learn and edX charge for certifying completion of their programs, but otherwise is free. The second type is programs like Insight and Data Incubator target, which are for science Ph.D.s transitioning from their fields into data science. Both offer highly intensive data science boot camps to build on the statistical skills acquired in a Ph.D. program. Both programs then serve as recruiters placing their students with companies. They make their money on the program from the recruiter fees (remember if its free, you’re the product). Cool win/win idea for recovering academics.

Training Buffets: Pay per Course
Several programs allow you to select data science training courses and pay per course. These programs often have a large catalog of courses and are reasonably priced ($7 - $10 per course). Data Oragami, Udemy, and some Udacity content are available on a per course basis. Good way to try a few classes to see if data science is right for you or pick up some specific skills. Dataversity also follows this model, but at a much higher price point ($79 - $129 per course). District Data Labs also offers a premium offering focused on corporate training ($25 per participant).

 Subscribe Now! Structured Curriculum with Paid Subscription
These data science training programs provide a structured curriculum with multiple learning paths for a low monthly rate. Coursera, Data Camp, Dataquest, Lynda, and O’Reilly all follow this model and offer monthly subscriptions from $25 to $50 a month. These programs incentivize you to hustle since you can learn at your own pace and the faster you move through the content, the less you pay. Data Camp and Dataquest appear to be some of the more popular in the data science community.

Old School: Structured Curriculum with Upfront Tuition
Not surprisingly, this old school model is the most prevalent way to offer data science training. Udacity is perhaps the king of this space offering the best value with good content in a structured course sequence ($499 - $699). The price goes up from there from $699 (Simplilearn Data Science) to $8500 (Thinkful). Brain Station, General Assembly, K2 Data Science, Springboard, and The Institute for Statistics Education all fall somewhere between these two price points. These programs typically differentiate themselves from the Subscribe Now! programs by offering one-on-one mentors that can help you through the program. If the one-on-one matters to you, this is the way to go. Otherwise, I did not see a lot of difference between the tuition and subscription based models. In fact, Springboard actually uses Data Camp’s content.

It almost seems like this might be a pretty good deal in terms of covering a wide range of topics and algorithms without going too deep into the math of a handful, and keeping you on-task with the materials with homework but not being incredibly time-consuming by forcing you to submit code weekly (given that most people taking this are probably working full-time).

"Hi all,

After a probationary period I lost my DS job at a startup. They realized they needed more software engineering (not my specialty) and less data analysis (more my specialty). They also weren't all about sales/marketing enablement yet, also a strength. A lot needed to be built. This was a new team and we were pretty much split between software and analysis but then it reached a point where I couldn't keep up with the new direction so that was the end of it. That and a ton of office politics that was poorly timed and took everyone by surprise. That said I loved my work on the analysis side, which included ML, and want to continue. Whether it's DS or a glorified data analyst title, that's what I'm going for.

However, all of my DS work was at this company and I have no portfolio. I lost it all in the sudden separation (not that I could share company work anyway so it's moot). Now I'm not sure how to get hired again without a portfolio. It was nearly impossible the first time. So I've decided to spend a month working on building one up based on all I've learned. Then I'll apply and keep building. As a recent job searcher, I really need a break to focus. However, what do I do about LinkedIn? On a paper resume I can highlight projects but my LinkedIn will just appear as if I have nothing going on. I hesitate to say self-employed because I'm not making myself money through the projects. Is there anything I can reasonably replace my position with to show I'm working productively with my time?

TLDR: Between work, taking a break to work on portfolio, how to show productive work on LinkedIn.

"Last night I had a #showerthought: Does it really matter when a movie is released? When I woke up this morning, the question was still on my mind, so I decided to mess around and see what I could find.

**THE CONCEPT**

I wanted to look at a couple different ways to portray release date and see how they affected the success of the movie. To do this, I first had to define a measurement of movie success. Seeing as it is the producing company who decides the release date of a movie, I decided to use the most important metric to them: $$$. However, it didn't make sense to use simply the revenue gained by the movie, because raw revenue numbers have an innate bias towards bigger movies with bigger budgets. For example, a movie with a production budget of $200 million that grosses $700 million would be considered extremely successful. However, so would a movie with a production budget of $20 million that grosses $70 million. Raw revenue number would show the second movie as being equally successful as a movie with a production budget of $200 million the grosses $250 million, which makes no sense. As such, I decided that my metric for success should be total revenue divided by production budget, thus scaling all of the movies to an equal scale.

The three portrayals of release date that I chose were week of the year, month of the year, and day of the week. 

**THE DATA**

At first, I used data scraped from [boxofficemojo.com](http://www.boxofficemojo.com), but then I realized that it only included data for movies that had grossed over $200 million. Seeing as that excludes a lot of the less successful movies (an important exclusion, since one of my variables is supposed to measure success), I had to switch. I ended up using data from the [TMDB 5,000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata/data), which is data in csv format regarding 5,000 movies. It included all of the values I needed, which were title, revenue, budget, and release date.

**THE DATA WRANGLING**

First, I calculated the necessary values. Revenue weighted by budget was easy enough, and I called it percent return. With my original data this name made a lot more sense. However, only as I typed this up did I realize that it is nonsensical. I'm too lazy to go back and fix it, so it will stay that way.

R deals with dates really well, so in order to display them on a graph, all I had to do was make a new column equal to the release date minus January 1 of the release year. I called this column, logically, days_since_jan_1.

To get week of the year, I subset the rows with day values in the correct range and set the correct week number. I applied this to all 52 weeks using a for loop. The 365th and 366th day (leap years) were thrown in with the 52nd week.

Month of the year was easy, I just pulled a substring out of the date value.

For day of the week, I converted the release date to a POSIXlt object and used $wday to record the numerical day of the week. Sunday is 0, Monday is 1, Tuesday is 2, etc.

**THE DISPLAY**

Now that I had the necessary values, I displayed them in a variety of formats. First, I created data frames of weekly, monthly, and daily medians and displayed them in scatterplots. These were the results: [Weekly](https://imgur.com/vrLmT1g), [monthly](https://imgur.com/2A3xIFT), and [daily](https://imgur.com/jOOiB0b). Remember, the days of the week are 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, etc.

However, since these graphs are automatically scaled, any small difference can look significant. For some context, I graphed them as box plots, too. [Weekly](https://imgur.com/3nRXjlQ), [monthly](https://imgur.com/LvAw6nD), and [daily](https://imgur.com/uv6J9Lw).

**STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE**

There's no real way to know if all of this work means anything until statistical significance tests are applied. I chose to use a one-factor T Test to compare the mean of each week/month/day to the population mean.

*Monthly Results*

I'm going to start broad and work my way in. With an alpha of 0.05, the months with a statistically significant difference from the population mean were:

* January (lower)
* March (lower)
* September (lower)
* October (lower)
* June (higher)
* November (higher)

When the alpha was lowered to 0.01, the months with a statistically significant difference from the population mean were:

* September (lower)
* June (higher)

*Conclusion:* Movies are most profitable when released in the early summer and towards the end of the year, and least profitable when released at the beginning of the year and at the beginning of the school year.

*Weekly Results*

With an alpha of 0.05, the weeks with a statistically significant difference from the population mean were:

* January 1-7 (lower)
* February 19-25 (lower)
* March 25-31 (lower)
* April 1-7 (lower)
* August 19-25 (lower)
* August 26-September 1 (lower)
* September 9-15 (lower)
* October 7-13 (lower)
* May 20-26 (higher)
* June 17-23 (higher)
* June 24-30 (higher)
* November 4-10 (higher)
* November 11-17 (higher)
* December 9-15 (higher)

When the alpha was lowered to 0.01, the weeks with a statistically significant difference from the population mean were:

* August 19-25 (lower)
* August 26-September 1 (lower)
* September 9-15 (lower)

"I'm an engineering student, graduating this summer and going to study MSc in Data Science next year. I only have a bit of machine learning experience from online courses and today I got an offer to do an internship related to Machine Learning with a small company.

Based on the interview, it seems like they don't know what they want. They have no experience with Machine Learning/Data Analysis at all nor any ""real"" data to do analysis on.

I'm skeptical of what I can achieve/learn from the internship and feel like I'll be studying online courses with them most of the time if I take it.

Should I take it or spend the summer developing my own portfolio? Is it worth to do it so that I can put it on my CV? It's getting late to apply for other internships as well.

"I'm interested to hear people's experiences working as a data scientist in a self employed capacity.

I've got a few companies on my CV where I've worked as a data scientist or machine learning specialist, sometimes in NLP and sometimes in images. Rather than the career path of working up to head of data science in a company, I'm interested in the idea of doing this independently, either as a freelance consultant or taking on 3 or 6 month long contracts at different companies.

For example I've seen a few job ads for data scientists needed for 3 month long data science projects, paid on a daily rate. I'm in the UK but I'm sure there is value in experiences from other countries too.

I'd like to know from somebody who's tried this and hear about your experiences.

"It's hard to know what you don't know. I have an economics background, and do some work with statistics and econometrics, can code moderately ok on R, and have learned some Python machine learning as well through udemy and independent reading... 

But even with that... there's two things:

1. I constantly run into things that I ""should"" know, but don't know. Even in my wheelhouse of econometrics there's way too much out there, and I don't know how to discover which are the ""basic""/""standard"" things that everyone ""should"" know.

2. I don't know how much mastery is necessary for you to be able to claim that you actually ""know"" something well enough for employment.

For me, I have a background in Econometrics and have been programming pretty heavily over the last 3 years. I only took one CS class in school – I wish I would've taken more.

As you might imagine, I spend a lot of time each day programming. I don't do a whole lot of data engineering – I'm more on the model-deployment side of things. I do build a lot of my own predictive models for work, which I have found to significantly ease my time spent deploying the model. Oftentimes, deploying models developed by other teams/individuals forces me to basically set things up my way, retrain the model using the same process/parameters, etc. Most of the other teams building models really don't think about the deployment phase, and therefore give almost zero fucks about engineering.

One of my other biggest regrets is not having taken more math in my undergrad. But I also am not that keen on knowing *that* much math – it really doesn't get me going, and I don't see myself wanting to take anything else after linear algebra, if I do in fact end up taking more math. I'm kind of looking for a role in analytics/data science that allows me to program (which I absolutely love) and do a bit of statistics along the way, without worrying too much about having to keep up with the really sophisticated math coming out of academia. For better or worse, it is really hard for me to get motivated about going back to take more math classes and potentially getting a master's degree.

"Some time ago in another thread I was asked how data science project at my work was going. And this is the answer. I think it could be interesting for junior or aspiring data scientists. There is not much machine learning, instead most part is devoted to working with data. In fact, if you don't work on projects with deep learning, don't write algorithms by yourself or don't do some other cool and innovative stuff, chances are that this will be most part of your job as well.

An introduction is in order. I am a junior data scientist in Russia; previously I have worked ~4 years as an IT-analyst in ERP-system implementation and then deciced to change career. I have talked about my way to data science [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/6df1tm/d_how_did_you_first_break_into_machine/di2hl9q/).

At first I hoped to get a job in an advanced IT-company so that I could use cool machine learning algorithms to predict whatever. The reality wasn't nice and I couldn't land a job due to serious requirements. At last I got hired by a bank and now I'm working on a project to predict probability of customer's positive reply to bank's offer.

I didn't think this at first, but the project turned out to be quite useful for my development as data scientist. There are many problems at this place of job, but at least it is relly good as a starting point.

One more important thing is that I am the only person doing machine learning in my department. Both of my bosses know some of it, but the first one uses SAS, and the other has little time to spare. So I do the project by myself and they help me with sql and with business insights.

Now for the project itself. 
The idea is the following: bank wants to offer credit cards to his clients (who already have a product in this bank). Client can reject the card, can activate it by himself or can activate it after a call from the bank (maybe they are reminding him about the card, offering better terms or saying something else).

I won't describe the project in very accurate terms so that I don't break NDA, but I'll give general description of project's stages. Also in 2011 the bank hosted a competition which was solving almost the same problem: predicting probability of customers response. Here is my jupyter notebook solving the challenge: [github link](https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Card_activation.ipynb) and [nbviewer link](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Card_activation.ipynb). As the notebook is strictly about challenge, any coincidences with my real work are pure coincidences, of course...

1) At first it it necessary to decide what exactly will the model predict. It isn't always obvious what exactly should be predicted. The discussion can take many days. Also the prediction should be actionable - I mean that business should be able to do something based on the prediction. This stage is crucial. Also accuracy metric needs to be defined, usually it is dictated by business needs.

2) After this starts data collection step. At first it is necessary to decide which data will be used. Another point is that you can't take all the data. Companies keep data for a long time, you can easily get millions of rows. So there are technical limitations. Also, are you sure that people behaved last year the same as in current year? And two years before? And 5 years? Choose the data carefully. And often you have to optimize sql queries - CTE, careful joins, reasonable filters and so on. This can decrease query run time significantly.

3) Now you can start working with data, this will take most of the time. I won't describe this step here, the notebook is about it. I just want to point that while notebook simply brushed some areas (like calculation correlations), in reality you'll pay a lot of attention to them. And business limitations are necessary. You may have to include some variables and to drop others. You could be able to create new variables or not. And so on.

Learn to do fancy tricks. In the notebook you can see an interesting way of splitting a continuous variable into bins using Decision Trees. Some people do it manually using their expert opinion. If the person is truly expert or has a great (and working) intuition - wonderful. Otherwise it could be a good idea to use some optimization.
If it is possible, automate the tasks and write functions. There are some examples in the notebook, but you'll need much more. For example, there is a function to select the best split for continuous variables. It is good... but will you use it each time for each variable? Surely, you may do it once for each variable or for most important of them, but doing it each time will be slow. It is better to write a function, which takes a list of columns and transforms all of them.
Do you need to plot a lot of similar graphs with different variables? Create some interactive plot (plotly or ipywidgets in python).

4) At last it is time for machine learning. In such a project you won't have a lot of freedom. Banks are binded with a lot of regulations, among them transparency. So it is likely that model has to be interpretable. This means that each variable should have a coefficient showing how much it contributes to the result. So no deep learning, no cool models. In fact logistic regression is a most likely choice. Though even with this you have some possibilities: tune parameters, choose the variables and so on.

5) Penultimate step is reporting. Having a model isn't enough, you need to show how it works and which results does it produce. Build excel report, make it nice and understandable. Add graphs and be ready to explain everything in it.

6) At last arrives the production step. So you have predicted probabilitied of positive response for customers. Maybe you can simply give the predictions to your colleagues and they will make decisions based on them; or you could need to work further and do something with this data.",An example of data science project in banking.

"Hi everyone, in the past days I have been looking around gathering some info about books, MOOCs and other video resources that could help me going from zero to entry level knowledge (yeah the _hero_ in the title is highly overestimated) for a future career in the Data Science field. I wanted to have a general feedback (specific questions are in the end of the post) and hopefully help other people by sharing my schedule.

# Personal background
31yrs old with a BS in Mechanical Engineering but I have always worked in the web development and web marketing industry. I don't have a math/stats background apart from the exams I took at university back then.

# Study plan and time schedule
In general I would prefer the Python path over R, simply because of its flexibility and multipurpose use.

These are roughly the learning blocks I will go through

1. Math & Statistics
2. Python in Data Science
3. Machine learning
4. Distributed computation frameworks
5. Practical experience

Here is a table outlining the _initial_ learning path

##### Legend
* the _Length_ is either in _nr of pages_ (if media is book) or _hours_ (if media is video)
* to calculate the _Eta (hrs)_ for the books I have used [this website](http://www.readinglength.com/book/isbn-1491912766/), set reading speed at 200wpm (I am not native english speaker) and multiplied by 2.5; for the videos I have multiplied the duration by 1.5
* to calculate the _Eta (days)_ I have considered to study ~4 hrs a day (I could dedicate more time, but I would prefer not to leave the job for now), so it's _Eta(hrs)/4_ rounded up

The total amount of time it would take to complete this curriculum is 146 days, considering I would probably take one day off every week, the total would be ~167 days. [Here is a gantt chart I did to estimate it](http://imgur.com/gBcoxGm). _If someone is interested in the spreadsheet with the various entries to adapt the chart to its schedule let me know_.

After the above schedule has been completed I would:

* Join Kaggle competitions on my own or [team up with other people](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/62mfaa/teamup_for_kaggle_competitions/)
* Follow local meetups
* Start listening to DS podcasts (Linear Digressions, Data Skeptic, Talking Machines...)
* Eventually join a datakind.org project
* Eventually follow some more specific course on [datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com)

_For each of the above learning blocks I have found other useful resources too that I would consider studying after completing the above schedule. To keep the post short I will not write them here. If someone is interested please let me know and I will share them._

# Questions
1. Is the curriculum well enough structured to give me a solid foundation to start working on some personal/open source projects and start building a portfolio?
2. Did I underestimate the time it would take to complete each book/course (or the total amount of time to complete the #1-19 table)?
3. Would you replace or add any book/course in the above schedule?
4. I would choose Python over R mostly because it can be useful for many other things other than Data Science. Do you think I should start with R or study both from the beginning?
5. If you have **any suggestion** to share I would love to hear them

What I did: 

I created a program in Microsoft visual studio that daily calls to the slack web api using zappyssys  to return a list of conversations, users, etc.(where the first bullet comes from). From there I wrote C# programs that converted unix epox times to EST and added missing columns of data to the return of the slack api. Then, I created a producer, consumer, and neutral data model in qlik sense; so that I had all of the desired functionality when creating analytics(where the second bullet comes from). Finally I built analytics though the usage of graphs in qlik sense that displayed and diagnosed the data (the 3rd bullet). 

Why I don't like this:

I feel like it reads like a list and is far too in depth, along with awkward phrasing and the potential to sound like I have no idea what I am talking about. 

Potential Changes:

1. I could turn bullet one and two into one bullet point so it would read like this:
designed and build an automated data gathering program from which I cleaned the data and created a functional model
1. If there is a well know high level process that includes the data gathering, cleaning, and data model creating step I could just include all of these bullets in that process
1. Change the phrasing to make it sound more professional 
1. Leave it alone because I am over thinking everything

"So here's the deal: I have been offered a funded 3 years data science PhD at one of the top UK universities, in London. The research project sounds very interesting, with a lot of practical learning. 

I accepted a few weeks ago a new job as a data analyst, actually my first job in the data science field. The company is very dynamic, they just created the position and I will be in some way the data expert of the team. To me, this represented an opportunity to experiment with large datasets, and to learn more elaborated concepts with online courses and by experimenting on the job. 

But now that that the PhD offer came in, I am wondering what is the most efficient way for me to become a data scientist. I read many contradicting opinions about this and it would be very helpful to get some advice.

I am worried that if I take the PhD, I will be getting a huge pay cut (about half of my current income) and I am not sure whether this will pay out in the end. What value do you think the PhD will add to my career path?

"I'm in my 5th year in an engineering PhD program at a top 5 US university. I have an MS from the same university. I have already decided I have no intention of pursuing academia and that industry will be my goal. My research is in statistical learning theory (stability) which I find not really applicable to data science in practice. I was hoping to finish my PhD studies by my 6th year but my advisor and committee told me I needed more results which would take me probably another 2 years. Also, my funding is running out next year which is a big a concern because I'll have to TA which may further slow down my research.

I started interviewing for full-time out of frustration and was surprised when I received two full-time data scientist offers, one of which is at a tech company which I would love to work for. Both places know that I'd intended to withdraw from my PhD. However, I have yet to submit the paperwork to withdraw nor have I informed my advisor because I fear that I am making a long-term mistake.

Will having a PhD benefit me any way in terms of career progression or future opportunities? Most data science managers I've seen have a PhD but I'm not sure this is standard across the industry. Given that I can already obtain a job in data science without a PhD, I'm not sure if the slight bump in compensation is worth another two years of research. I would love to get some thoughts from current data scientists, especially those who faced a similar dilemma.

Edit: I forgot to mention that I have done a summer internship as a data scientist (different company from the ones I got the full-time). This experience really solidify my goal to work as a data scientist and how I explained to recruiters about leaving school.

**EDIT**: I think my best idea right now is to ask for the team to use ""associate"" instead of ""junior"" maybe for me and the soon-to-be new hire, and maybe add a co-title implying 'team lead' or 'assistant Analytics manager'","""Snr Data Analyst"" or ""Jr Data Scientist"": boss wants me to pick my title",4ul8mn,top,51.0,31.0,31.0,0.0

"I am finishing up my PhD and have started looking for jobs seriously. I have spent the last month or so(approx 40 days) just attending a bunch of data scientist interviews. The experience has been fascinating and valuable. Understanding the diversity of the problem domains has been a real eye opener. As with all interviews, there were a few not-so-good experiences. These experiences usually occurred when the the job requirements were mis-classified as a data scientist instead of a software engineer.

From my experience, startups usually had the most well rounded interview processes. They were, for the most part, a mix of code days and one on one interviews to explain your approach. Maybe the bigger companies have time constraints on the hiring process, because most of them felt quite rushed and one-sided.

Attending these interviews has actually streamlined my job-search process by giving me certain areas/problem domains to focus on.

"How do you approach investigating new data sets and extracting/engineering relevant features and methods for achieving your tasks? While the classes I’ve taken have stressed machine learning, only some of them discussed data investigation. The closest I came to data investigation was in time series where we analyzed correlation coefficients, stationarity and stability, regression coefficient significance, etc.

When I think of data exploration, I think of first cleaning the dataset (which could mean different things based on the type of data). Next, finding various ways to categorize the data, computing some statistics on these groups and doing hypothesis tests. Groupings can be done categorically or via clustering/PCA. If the data isn’t of the categorical type (let’s say an audio signal), you can extract various features like MFCC, pitch, etc. 

After this is it plug and chug to see how well models perform? How do you choose which models are best suited for your task? Is there a better approach to data exploration? Thanks!",What’s your data investigation workflow ?,93uppj,top,8.0,31.0,31.0,0.0
"I'll try to explain this briefly as possible. Basically, there is a certain product line our company sells with many different products. We want to classify products into different behavioural product lifecycle groups  for future forecasts. This was a pretty simple problem for me. Glancing over the data, it seems that behavior is mostly attributed to product popularity. Also, the less popular a product is, a more erratic its lifecycle can be.

Since different products can be around the same level of popularity, but still have different levels of sales volume, I scaled the sales data for each product. Then, I plotted each product on the same plot to compare trends. I would start with the most popular product, then add more products in decreasing order of popularity. Most behaved a certain trend, some didn't (which I separated into a different group). If I kept adding products and deviations persisted, I would finalize the sales threshold to establish the certain behavioral product group.

So I show this approach to my boss, and he basically says I'm overcomplicating it. He says I should look at each product individually, and just keep looking at individual graphs and see what trends arise. Bear in mind, I'm comparing over 30 different products, potentially hundreds. So I did that to entertain the idea, and just as I expected, it was impossible to analyze and I didn't learn anything new that my original approach showed me. I don't know what to do. I feel like I cannot communicate with my boss about this because we are from different backgrounds. I literally have proof that ignoring scaling can lead to huge forecasting errors, but I feel like my opinion is disregarded and that I'm ""overcomplicating"" the problem. I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm losing my mind, this approach seems completely valid to me.

EDIT: Just some additional thoughts. I've been continually showing great solutions with R to this problem and various others, and management has recently been shunning R. They say it won't accomplish anything, and that it all can be done with just Excel. This just seems like a horrible mindset. I'm trying to offer them solutions to automate analytical processes and I feel like they just want the simplest solution possible.

I moved to a smaller city for my SO's job. We're going to be here for at least 3 years, possibly 6.


I took a data analyst job for a local company, thinking the role would be much more technical than it actually is (I'm a glorified number aggregater.)

My fear is that I'm not growing/learning the more advanced skills I want to eventually move into a more advanced role, **so my questions are:**

1. What should I be doing on my own to make sure I am qualified for a more advanced data scientist role in the future?


2. Are any decent jobs in the this field that allow people to work remotely? (In case I end up staying in this small city for 6 years and I can't find anything locally)

 

*Add'l info*:

I have a BS in finance and an MBA concentrating in data analytics, which includes 2 years helping teach statistics to undergrads. I am proficient in SQL and VBA, along with a basic understanding of R (can write basic stuff from scratch; decent at editing others' code for my own use).

"Data science as a field is obviously booming, and there is a lack in the supply qualified data scientists compared to the demand. In recent years, some services offering automated data analysis, like [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/), have come online, and they are incredibly impressive. For those unfamiliar with them, they utilize machine learning algorithms to determine the structure of the data itself, run hundreds of possible models and algorithms, and outputs all of them, including ranking them by various performance measures and allowing someone to then integrate the model or results of their choice into their projects. All someone has to do is upload their data and DataRobot takes it from there. It is essentially automating the process of data science that takes place between collecting/structuring the data, and using the results of the model. 

And it is quite good. I have a colleague who spent a summer as an intern on the data science team for a fairly large financial company, and they hosted a intracompany Kaggle competition, and he said some of the people had some very impressive performances, but someone tried using DataRobot on the same problem for comparison and it blew everyone out of the water.

And though DataRobot is one of the first and better known platforms, it certainly will not be the last. I know of some startups that are aiming to compete with DataRobot in the near future.

So my question is, what do you think this means for the field of data science? Is this just another tool that will be incorporated into the data science toolbox? Are there aspects of the field that automated services like DataRobot will struggle to compete with real, human data scientists? Or will these services disrupt the industry and kill off the need for individuals with data science expertise that are in such demand right now?","How do you see automated data science platforms such as DataRobot affecting the field going forward?
