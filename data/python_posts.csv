I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

&lt;p&gt;I want the program to run in a similar way that vim or ranger do, i.e. run the program, clear screen, on closing the program the terminal is back to the state it was before opening the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are these things usually done? Should I look into something like ncurses?&lt;/p&gt;

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget.

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

&lt;p&gt;I want the program to run in a similar way that vim or ranger do, i.e. run the program, clear screen, on closing the program the terminal is back to the state it was before opening the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are these things usually done? Should I look into something like ncurses?&lt;/p&gt;

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget.

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

&lt;p&gt;I want the program to run in a similar way that vim or ranger do, i.e. run the program, clear screen, on closing the program the terminal is back to the state it was before opening the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are these things usually done? Should I look into something like ncurses?&lt;/p&gt;

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

&lt;p&gt;I want the program to run in a similar way that vim or ranger do, i.e. run the program, clear screen, on closing the program the terminal is back to the state it was before opening the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are these things usually done? Should I look into something like ncurses?&lt;/p&gt;

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget.

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

&lt;p&gt;I want the program to run in a similar way that vim or ranger do, i.e. run the program, clear screen, on closing the program the terminal is back to the state it was before opening the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are these things usually done? Should I look into something like ncurses?&lt;/p&gt;

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget.

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

This is my script below, would this work for what I want?

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

&lt;p&gt;We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have wired the machine &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; to pin 17, and the machine &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot; to pin 22, so each pin should go &amp;quot;low&amp;quot; when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.&lt;/p&gt;

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

&lt;p&gt;We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have wired the machine &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; to pin 17, and the machine &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot; to pin 22, so each pin should go &amp;quot;low&amp;quot; when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.&lt;/p&gt;

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

This is my script below, would this work for what I want?

        import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

&lt;p&gt;We have wired the machine &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; to pin 17, and the machine &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot; to pin 22, so each pin should go &amp;quot;low&amp;quot; when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my script below, would this work for what I want?&lt;/p&gt;

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am building a web app that allows users to build data analysis models using a limited set of variables and deploy these models to apply the parameters on IoT streaming data and generate triggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end.

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

This is my script below, would this work for what I want?

        import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.&lt;/p&gt;

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses).

Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am building a web app that allows users to build data analysis models using a limited set of variables and deploy these models to apply the parameters on IoT streaming data and generate triggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda?

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget.

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget.

For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget. &lt;/p&gt;

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

However the pronouns aren't properties of the gender, it needs to use a get() on the enum .value. I was wondering if there's a way to implement this using class variables and having the pronouns as properties while retaining the Gender identity the Enum implementation has.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently implementing a gender module with pronoun data using class variables as each gender type and pronoun. This is what I have so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Gender:
    class Male:
        NOMINATIVE = &amp;quot;He&amp;quot;
        OBJECTIVE = &amp;quot;Him&amp;quot;
    class Female:
        # etc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A male person instance would have a Male Gender type var like this: person.gender = Gender.Male, and from there I can retrieve their correct pronoun based on the pronoun type. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works well but it doesn&amp;#39;t consider Male and Female as a Gender, so I implemented a solution using Enum that does:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Pronoun(Enum):
    NOMINATIVE, OBJECTIVE = range(2)

class Gender(Enum):
    MALE = {Pronoun.NOMINATIVE: &amp;quot;He&amp;quot;, Pronoun.OBJECTIVE: &amp;quot;Him&amp;quot;}
    #FEMALE = etc...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the pronouns aren&amp;#39;t properties of the gender, it needs to use a get() on the enum .value. I was wondering if there&amp;#39;s a way to implement this using class variables and having the pronouns as properties while retaining the Gender identity the Enum implementation has.&lt;/p&gt;

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

This is what I have so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Gender:
    class Male:
        NOMINATIVE = &amp;quot;He&amp;quot;
        OBJECTIVE = &amp;quot;Him&amp;quot;
    class Female:
        # etc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A male person instance would have a Male Gender type var like this: person.gender = Gender.Male, and from there I can retrieve their correct pronoun based on the pronoun type. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works well but it doesn&amp;#39;t consider Male and Female as a Gender, so I implemented a solution using Enum that does:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Pronoun(Enum):
    NOMINATIVE, OBJECTIVE = range(2)

class Gender(Enum):
    MALE = {Pronoun.NOMINATIVE: &amp;quot;He&amp;quot;, Pronoun.OBJECTIVE: &amp;quot;Him&amp;quot;}
    #FEMALE = etc...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the pronouns aren&amp;#39;t properties of the gender, it needs to use a get() on the enum .value. I was wondering if there&amp;#39;s a way to implement this using class variables and having the pronouns as properties while retaining the Gender identity the Enum implementation has.&lt;/p&gt;

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

I'm working on a small program that involves a bunch of `print()` and `input()`.

I want the program to run in a similar way that vim or ranger do, i.e. run the program, clear screen, on closing the program the terminal is back to the state it was before opening the program.

How are these things usually done? Should I look into something like ncurses?

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

&lt;p&gt;How are these things usually done? Should I look into something like ncurses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget.

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

&lt;p&gt;I want the program to run in a similar way that vim or ranger do, i.e. run the program, clear screen, on closing the program the terminal is back to the state it was before opening the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are these things usually done? Should I look into something like ncurses?&lt;/p&gt;

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget.

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

&lt;p&gt;We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have wired the machine &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; to pin 17, and the machine &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot; to pin 22, so each pin should go &amp;quot;low&amp;quot; when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.&lt;/p&gt;

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

This is my script below, would this work for what I want?

        import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

&lt;p&gt;We have wired the machine &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; to pin 17, and the machine &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot; to pin 22, so each pin should go &amp;quot;low&amp;quot; when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my script below, would this work for what I want?&lt;/p&gt;

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am building a web app that allows users to build data analysis models using a limited set of variables and deploy these models to apply the parameters on IoT streaming data and generate triggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end.

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget.

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget.

&lt;p&gt;I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget.

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget. &lt;/p&gt;

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

This is what I have so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Gender:
    class Male:
        NOMINATIVE = &amp;quot;He&amp;quot;
        OBJECTIVE = &amp;quot;Him&amp;quot;
    class Female:
        # etc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A male person instance would have a Male Gender type var like this: person.gender = Gender.Male, and from there I can retrieve their correct pronoun based on the pronoun type. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works well but it doesn&amp;#39;t consider Male and Female as a Gender, so I implemented a solution using Enum that does:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Pronoun(Enum):
    NOMINATIVE, OBJECTIVE = range(2)

class Gender(Enum):
    MALE = {Pronoun.NOMINATIVE: &amp;quot;He&amp;quot;, Pronoun.OBJECTIVE: &amp;quot;Him&amp;quot;}
    #FEMALE = etc...

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

I'm working on a small program that involves a bunch of `print()` and `input()`.

I want the program to run in a similar way that vim or ranger do, i.e. run the program, clear screen, on closing the program the terminal is back to the state it was before opening the program.

How are these things usually done? Should I look into something like ncurses?

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

&lt;p&gt;How are these things usually done? Should I look into something like ncurses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget.

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

&lt;p&gt;We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have wired the machine &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; to pin 17, and the machine &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot; to pin 22, so each pin should go &amp;quot;low&amp;quot; when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.&lt;/p&gt;

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.

&lt;p&gt;We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have wired the machine &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; to pin 17, and the machine &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot; to pin 22, so each pin should go &amp;quot;low&amp;quot; when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a script that creates the network map automatically. The sudo portion near the top is so I can open that folder and write to it.&lt;/p&gt;

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So i have this huge folder of Tiff (16 Bit) files i need to read in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously i am limited to 32 GB of RAM. So ASAP i read everything with cv2 function and stacked every image along an axis to an 3D array, i get an Memory Error. &lt;/p&gt;

I know. Let's get to the details.

TL:DR - I joined a great bunch of programmers in this slack channel linked at the bottom to learn to build MUDs as my way to learn Python+Django+Channels. Would love to chat with others that love the MUD hobby!

&amp;nbsp;

I am still pretty new to python - about 6 months in - but am quickly getting my hands dirty. I have some experience with using Python and Django together but am really trying to get a better handle on Python before I go much further.

&amp;nbsp;

As a fun way to learn by gamifying my experience, I am going back to my MUD roots to create an engine from scratch. Fun, I know! It's been a lot of work, and so far it really just looks like a lot of interactive fiction for one person but it's been a super fun process.

&amp;nbsp;

The long term goal is to develop a MUD with Python while using Django+Channels as the websocket implementation. I think Channels is not super super new, but there do not seem to be to many implementations of it that I could find. At least not in tutorial form.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, the main point was to introduce the idea of creating a MUD with these tools for anyone who is interested in helping or joining in a learning experience. I know I could use all the help I can get.

&amp;nbsp;

I joined a slack of programmers that are all MUD hobbyists that work in a wide range of languages, but i am one of the few working with Python. I hope that's not a bad omen.

I need some help figuring out how to port my tools over. I have quite a number of tools utilizing SQLite.  Then we had a change in policy that no one will have write access to the server anymore. For our code to write anything we need to use the FTP module. When I asked about the use of SQLite, I was told that I need to ""*rethink my design.*"" So SQL is out of the question since we are not running any SQL server either.

I've been too upset to tackle this task with a clear mind and I need help please :(  I will probably need to use json.

Here's 1 immediate tool I need to get working. It's a little scheduler that allows a user to book their own workstation in advance to be excluded  or included from render farm on a day by day basis. The interface displays a calendar with white background for neutral, green for including, red for excluding. This same data is read by a CRON job which fires every 15 minutes controlling the farm.  It does other things too but the most important 3 columns all live in the same table.

* date :  int  in YYMMDD format. Works really nicely I can query range of dates, before after or specific date.
* machine name
* state : include or exclude. Machines are considered neutral until they gets added to the table for that specific date.

\- having 1 json per day would be good for the CRON but horrible for user since user needs to see the calendar, there will be lots of looping to get all the data.

\- having 1 json per user  is also horrible for the CRON, again, lots of loop.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am building a web app that allows users to build data analysis models using a limited set of variables and deploy these models to apply the parameters on IoT streaming data and generate triggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better?

We have machines at work we want to monitor. We want to monitor and log when the machine starts and the machine stops.

We have wired the machine ""start"" to pin 17, and the machine ""stop"" to pin 22, so each pin should go ""low"" when the loop is complete/true, and make the log in a CSV file.

They should never be both low at the same time. And once machine start goes low, it needs to wait until machine stop to go low, before it logs machine start again. And it basically just loops between start/stop forever, logging each time it happens. I also added a slight sleep delay as it would log every nanosecond.

It records the date/time, 1 or 0, and a comment to a CSV file on the network share.

Could anyone explain what am I doing wrong?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, I am currently learning Python pandas and I am struggling for almost an entire day trying to concatenate two data frames I made with .csv files. The result of my efforts in joining the two dfs are in the image attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was what I did to concatenate the two data frames&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;df3 = pd.concat([df, df2], sort = False)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I join both dataframe such that I becomes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marriage Rates (Males)  Marriage Rates (Females)   Total Fertility Rate (Per Female)    Net Reproduction Rate&lt;/p&gt;

I know. Let's get to the details.

TL:DR - I joined a great bunch of programmers in this slack channel linked at the bottom to learn to build MUDs as my way to learn Python+Django+Channels. Would love to chat with others that love the MUD hobby!

&amp;nbsp;

I am still pretty new to python - about 6 months in - but am quickly getting my hands dirty. I have some experience with using Python and Django together but am really trying to get a better handle on Python before I go much further.

&amp;nbsp;

As a fun way to learn by gamifying my experience, I am going back to my MUD roots to create an engine from scratch. Fun, I know! It's been a lot of work, and so far it really just looks like a lot of interactive fiction for one person but it's been a super fun process.

&amp;nbsp;

The long term goal is to develop a MUD with Python while using Django+Channels as the websocket implementation. I think Channels is not super super new, but there do not seem to be to many implementations of it that I could find. At least not in tutorial form.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, the main point was to introduce the idea of creating a MUD with these tools for anyone who is interested in helping or joining in a learning experience. I know I could use all the help I can get.

&amp;nbsp;

I joined a slack of programmers that are all MUD hobbyists that work in a wide range of languages, but i am one of the few working with Python. I hope that's not a bad omen.

&amp;nbsp;

If you're interested in seeing what I'm doing and/or joining in the process to work together or simply to chat about MUDs in Python, come check it out!

&lt;p&gt;I am still pretty new to python - about 6 months in - but am quickly getting my hands dirty. I have some experience with using Python and Django together but am really trying to get a better handle on Python before I go much further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a fun way to learn by gamifying my experience, I am going back to my MUD roots to create an engine from scratch. Fun, I know! It&amp;#39;s been a lot of work, and so far it really just looks like a lot of interactive fiction for one person but it&amp;#39;s been a super fun process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long term goal is to develop a MUD with Python while using Django+Channels as the websocket implementation. I think Channels is not super super new, but there do not seem to be to many implementations of it that I could find. At least not in tutorial form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the main point was to introduce the idea of creating a MUD with these tools for anyone who is interested in helping or joining in a learning experience. I know I could use all the help I can get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined a slack of programmers that are all MUD hobbyists that work in a wide range of languages, but i am one of the few working with Python. I hope that&amp;#39;s not a bad omen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re interested in seeing what I&amp;#39;m doing and/or joining in the process to work together or simply to chat about MUDs in Python, come check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

I need some help figuring out how to port my tools over. I have quite a number of tools utilizing SQLite.  Then we had a change in policy that no one will have write access to the server anymore. For our code to write anything we need to use the FTP module. When I asked about the use of SQLite, I was told that I need to ""*rethink my design.*"" So SQL is out of the question since we are not running any SQL server either.

I've been too upset to tackle this task with a clear mind and I need help please :(  I will probably need to use json.

Here's 1 immediate tool I need to get working. It's a little scheduler that allows a user to book their own workstation in advance to be excluded  or included from render farm on a day by day basis. The interface displays a calendar with white background for neutral, green for including, red for excluding. This same data is read by a CRON job which fires every 15 minutes controlling the farm.  It does other things too but the most important 3 columns all live in the same table.

* date :  int  in YYMMDD format. Works really nicely I can query range of dates, before after or specific date.
* machine name
* state : include or exclude. Machines are considered neutral until they gets added to the table for that specific date.

\- having 1 json per day would be good for the CRON but horrible for user since user needs to see the calendar, there will be lots of looping to get all the data.

\- having 1 json per user  is also horrible for the CRON, again, lots of loop.

\- having 1 gigantic json file is... no.

Cool.

Haven't seen any examples quite like this.

And my python is a little rusty.

Let's say for example, we have one or two standard html pages

each with a standard form in them/

&amp;#x200B;

**&lt;form method=""POST"" action=""**[**text.py**](https://text.py)**""&gt;**

**&lt;form method=""POST"" action=""**[**radio.py**](https://radio.py)**""&gt;** 

 radio buttons  a simple multiple choice form with radio buttons, user checks only one.

&amp;#x200B;

First, how could I put [radio.py](https://radio.py) and [text.py](https://text.py) in another folder - cgi, www, opt  ????? - somewhere other than the document root i.e. public.html  and would it still be able to execute?

A sym link????  wsgi?? etc.

Let's say a put a pickle script in cgi, or www,or opt, how could I pickle the input from radio and text py and send it to another folder for quarantine and to read it later - maybe add a time stamp so that I know when it came in.

Need more info.  ""How to"".  Not quite sure what to even search for - hide python, obfuscate python, pickle form data???

No, I don't want to convert everything to django or Flask Bootstrap just to try a little experiment.  But I'm aware of the security vulnerablities if you take part of a static site (a web page) and add a dynamic element (i.e. a comment form).

What does it do? It maintains a state between transitions, calls the target class's \_\_new\_\_ and \_\_init\_\_ on conversion, doesn't require matching signatures for \*anything\* (meaning a completely decoupled conversion between otherwise incompatible and isolated classes) , and permits unique instances of pre-bind and post-bind borg pod classes (unlike Singleton) while maintaining a consistent ID between conversion and references to the same pod (unlike the Borg idiom).

How to use?

Just add @borg\_pod.assimilate above classes you wish to cast between, and you're good! To cast an instance into a new class, you can use YourAssimilatedClass(another\_assimilated\_instance) or pretty much any combination you can think of (queen=another\_assimilated\_instance is the keyword if you want to be explicit) without adjusting your \_\_init\_\_ signature to allow an extra input, as the queen or first instance of a queen class (\_base\_class as a \_\_new\_\_ optional kwarg, default\_class as a wrapper optional kwarg, or just the BorgPod class in borg\_pod) is removed from \*args or \*\*kwargs.
