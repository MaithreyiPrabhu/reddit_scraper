There were two people there to take the test that day; one was Mr. Fred who was a certified electrical engineer. and, of course, Boudreaux was the other. 

They each took the test and returned to Mr. Don's office to hand in their test papers. Mr. Don asked the both of them to wait outside until he was done overlooking the two exams. After about 10 minutes Mr. Don called them back in and this is how it went: 

Mr. Don- Thanks to the both of you for applying for the position. We have made our decision and that decision is to hire Fred. 

Boudreaux- What did Fred score on dat test? 

Mr. Don- Ya'll both scored 9 outta ten. You both only missed one question

"&#x200B;

Once upon a time, on the tropical island of Adiaster, a primitive tribe lived in a village of grass huts. There were no rival tribes on the island, no natural disasters to speak of, and no huge monsters that might emerge from the jungle in a primal rage to destroy the village. In general, life was good.

And life was about to get better! For on this particular day, a new king was ascending to the throne. Before his succession to the throne, the king had been a notorious party animal; he threw parties almost every day, and villagers flocked to his hut to participate. Ever the life of the party, the king had always been gracious host, and when his succession became imminent, villagers rejoiced at the prospect of such an amiable king.

But no kingdom is perfect, and this kingdom;s problem was classism (a problem many other kingdoms have had as well). Within this tribe, the hunters were at the top of the social hierarchy. They garnered glory and respect from their daring hunts, and were generally seen as the coolest kids on the block. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the builders and engineers of the tribe were considered the lowest class. They were often referred to as ""*nerds""* , an ancient Adiasterese term meaning ""those who bury their nose in books and diagrams all night long and have got no game"" (Adiasterese etymology is quite fascinating). As such, builders and engineers were often excluded from the kingdom's social events.

The king knew this. In fact, he had perpetuated this classism even before ascending to the throne. Even though he had never purposefully excluded engineers from his parties back in the day, nearly every attendant had been a hunter, creating an environment that would have made engineers feel incredibly uncomfortable if they showed up. The king resolved to bridge this gap between the classes of his tribe, and to do this, he promised to throw a lavish party on his coronation day. This was going to be a party for the ages: it was to be held in the palace, it was to last all night long, and everyone was invited.

This presented a problem, however. Although the palace was larger than any other hut in the village, it still wasn't large enough to hold everyone. The king decided to prepare for this by instructing his engineers to build a second floor to the palace, so that the entire tribe could party in his new house.

The head engineer was slightly nervous about the structural integrity of a hut with two stories, and he voiced those concerns to his future king. The king would not have it. ""This must be the party of a lifetime!"" he declared. ""This will bring our tribe closer together and usher in a new age of equality between hunters and engineers. You shall be in attendance as my guest of honor! You MUST build a second floor!"" When the head engineer remained uncertain, the king leaned into his head engineer's ear and whispered ""I heard there'd be *girls* at this party, too,"" and eventually the head engineer relented. The second floor to the palace was built.

This new palace was the talk of the town! Everyone thought it was the most impressive hut they had ever seen. But the king, though he would never admit it to anyone, was nervous about his coronation party. If the party wasn't *poppin'*(meaning ""a happy time for everyone involved"", usually associated with a public event that anyone can enter, as opposed to ""*lit""*, which usually carries the connotation of a more private event), it could fracture his kingdom for generations. To improve his chances of a *poppin'* party, the king called the head engineer into his chambers the night before the party and demanded that a disco ball be installed in the ceiling of the first floor.

The head engineer was flabbergasted. Not only was this incredibly short notice, but a heavy object putting pressure on the center of the building could result in the entire house collapsing. He argued with the king for hours, but the king remained undeterred. The next morning, mere minutes before the coronation began, the final touches on the disco ball were finished. The coronation itself went off without a hitch, the king was carried into his palace on his throne, and as the sun set, it was time to party.

The king had scheduled the party to begin as soon as night fell, and as soon as the sun had dipped below the horizon, the palace was flooded with people (which was highly unusual; In Adiasterese culture, it is customary to arrive to a party 45-60 minutes after the scheduled starting time). All the king's worries about his party faded immediately upon seeing the eager crowd; throngs of hunters, healers, fishermen, and even engineers had filed into his palace and having the time of their lives. Eventually, the head engineer arrived, and true to his word, the king loudly announced his guest of honor to a rowdy cheer. As the night wore on, the tribe seemed to grow closer. Hunters and engineers laughed together, drank together, and even played *pong* together (a traditional Adiasterese game in which small rocks are thrown at jugs of fermented fruit). Everything was going according to plan.

In the middle of the night, as the party continued, the king noticed that many of the partygoers had spilled drinks all over his throne. Ordinarily, this would have resulted in capital punishment; the throne had been passed down through generations of royalty and was sacred to the inhabitants of the village. But the king knew that now was not the time for punishment. It was a party! Getting all serious and traditional now could ruin the unity that he had worked so hard to foster. In order to save his throne from more desecration, he ordered several hunters to carry it upstairs, where no drinks were being served.

The head engineer, upon seeing this, yelled at the king to stop. He knew that if an object as heavy as the royal throne was brought onto the second floor of the house, the whole building would collapse. Unfortunately, the king was enjoying the party too much to be concerned with the head engineer's worries. ""Oh come on!"" he roared, ""enjoy the party! You've done enough worrying for a lifetime. Have some fun!""

But the king should have heeded his engineer's warning. For at that moment, as the throne was placed on the second floor, the hut collapsed. The party dissolved as the surviving tribespeople fled the scene. When the king came to, nearly half of his tribe had died, including his head engineer.

\~

Ten years later, the king still ruled his tribe. He still threw parties every day, in his rebuilt palace, and as always everyone was invited. But he still remembered that day that he lost half his tribe and one of his closest friends. To anyone who would listen, he would repeat the valuable lessons he learned that day:

"A mother and father take their 6-year old son to a family nude beach...

As the boy walks along the sand, he notices that many of the women have boobs bigger than his mother's, so he goes back to ask her why.

She tells her son, 'The bigger they are, the sillier the lady is.'

The boy, pleased with the answer, goes to play in the ocean but returns to tell his mother that many of the men have larger things than his dad does.

She replies, 'The bigger they are, the dumber the man is.'

Again satisfied with her answer, the boy goes back to the ocean to play.

Shortly thereafter, the boy returns and promptly tells his mother:

Cleveland Browns football practice was delayed nearly two hours today after a player reported finding an unknown white powdery substance on the practice field.

Coach Hue Jackson immediately suspended practice while police and federal investigators were called to investigate.

After a complete analysis, FBI forensic experts determined that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line.

Practice was resumed after special agents decided the team was unlikely to encounter the substance again.

"There once was a peaceful agrarian village at the edge of an enchanted forest. The village lived mostly self-sufficiently with farmers specializing in crops and trading with other farmers for goods and services. Jack, a humble sugar cane farmer, lived in this village when something horrible happened one night.

One morning, Old Man Richards woke to find half his cows slaughtered and eaten. Amid the corpses and bones were large, monstrous foot prints leading from Old Man Richards cows and into the forest. Word quickly spread of the butchering as Old Man Richards lived in the middle of the village and everyone who went about to trade that day had to pass by. 

That night, a horrible sound came from the chicken coups on Farmer Hopkins land. The same large foot prints from the previous night could be seen coming from the forest, passed Old Man Richards cows and into Farmer Hopkins coups. The village could not deny that something was terrorizing them and by mid day, every man woman and child had gathered in the center of the village near where the cows and chickens had been taken.

The villagers came to call the creature the ""Midicrin"" after it's propensity to strike lands in the middle of the village. They deduced that the Midicrin would strike one of three places next, Miss Angie's prize loons, for which the village had become renowned for during the few times it traded with other townships, a blackberry patch owned by Ernest Eford who was somehow older than Old Man Richards, or Jack's sugar cane farm.  

Jack sat awake all night keeping an eye on the distant forest tree line and his sugar cane fields. After what seemed like an entire day's worth of time, a strange soft pounding sound startled Jack. A terrible creature as tall as the tallest building in the village with legs as long as Jack's entire body came lumbering toward him. Paralyzed with fear, Jack watched as the Midicrin stalked forward with a ghostly silence and grabbed a mouthful of sugar cane. As the beast continued his eating, Jack watched the monster suddenly lurch and hurl up his nightly meal. The beast fell for a moment before slowly getting back up and stalking back toward the forest. 

Jack called the meeting later that day to tell of his encounter that night. Everyone became loud with cheers when Jack told of how the beast fell ill after consuming the cane. Then, Jack told the town of his idea. Surly after not eating it's usual meal the previous night, the Midicrin would be hungrier than usual. Jack postured that if they fed Miss Angie's loons with the sugar cane, the beast would inadvertently fall sick again and the entire village, hidden in waiting, could come out at once and strike the beast. 

Jack gathered as much sugar cane as he could afford to lose and brought them next door to Miss Angie's birds. After setting the trap, the village waited for night to fall and the creature to return. Sure enough, the Midicrin came back, past Old Man Richards' cows, past Farmer Hopkin's chickens, and of course past Jack's poisonous sugar cane. The Midcrin came to Miss Angies birds and began to feed ravenously. It was only after a short time that it stopped, hurled out what it had eaten, and fell backward. The entire village, charging with pitchforks and lit torched, began to berate the Midicrin until it had spilled enough blood to surely be dead. 

The moral of the story, as Jack explained, was that a loon full of sugar helps the Midicrin go down. ",The Story of Jack the Sugar Cane farmer,9da3b3,new

"This was back when MTV played music videos. So, he's watching a heavy metal music video, and the guitarist plays an amazing solo. The horse says ""that looks amazing, I want to do that!""

The horse goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play guitar."" Says the horse.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the horse. ""I'm a horse.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.

""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.""

Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums."" Says the chicken.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the chicken. ""I'm a chicken.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.

Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow.

""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""

""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow.""

""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""

Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.

One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""

The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.

Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.

Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.

The night is going well and everyone is having fun. Her husband introduces her to a new colleague of his, Mr. Lee, and Mr. Lee happens to be Chinese.

Mr. Lee comments on her sweater saying he could tell it took a long time and was very intricate. This made the woman super happy and thanked him. 

Mr. Lee then asked where she got the symbols from, and when she told him he let out a pained chuckle. He then asked her if she wanted to know what her sweater said. She had guessed some kind of food, but was always curious, so she said yes.

After you've been at it for a while, if a position opens up somewhere else, you can spend a few days trying out casting or reeling.

If you're good enough, though, you can earn a spot working on the pier, where they get twice as many fish.  And if you're a master of your specialty, you can get a place out there at the very end.  That's where they catch the most and the best fish, and that's where I work!""

The girl doesn't find this very interesting, but she goes out with her uncle and watches and helps for a few hours at the end of the pier.  She hates it.  The bate is disgusting, the hooks keep on pricking her.  It's miserable.  About halfway through the day, though a spot opens up out on the street, and she jumps at the chance to get away from her Uncle's prized job.

That night, at dinner, her mother asks, ""So, how was your day with your uncle?  Where did you go?  What did you learn?""

She thinks for a minute before replying:  ""We went to the shore today, and I learned one thing for certain.

Not wanting to hit the frog, he bends down and moves the frog onto a rock nearby. As he sets up his 8 iron shot, he hears the frog croak 'ribbit 9 iron'. Strange, he thought but what the heck. He pulls out his 9 iron and hits a perfect shot onto the green, 2 feet from the pin. With a smile he turns to the frog and said 'you must be my lucky charm'. The frog hops onto his cart and proceeds to tell him the exact perfect club for each shot that day and the man ends up shooting the round of his life.

Following the round of golf the man takes the frog home, beer in hand, the man smiled at the frog and said 'you must be my lucky charm'!  You gave me the greatest golf round I've ever played, is there anything I can do for you?' The frog looked the man in the eyes and said 'Ribbit, kiss me'. After a wince, the man thinks what the heck and picks the frog up and gives it a kiss. Like magic, the frog suddenly turned into a beautiful, blond, naked...19 year old girl.

...and I swear, your honor, that's exactly how she ended up in my room or my name isn't Donal J Trump!

"A man was speeding along the road in a van, doing well over 100, until he was pulled over by a police car. 

""Sir, do you know how fast you were going? Let me see your license""

The man responded ""Officer, I don't have a license""

""What?? Where is the paperwork for this van?""

""I don't have any paperwork, this is a stolen van. I was making a drug run when you stopped me.""

The officer immediately pulled the man out of the van, handcuffed him, and put him in the back of his police car before calling for backup.

10 minutes later, there were several police cars on the scene, including the officers supervisor and a drug sniffing dog.

The supervisor pulled the man out of the back of the police car to interview him.

""So let me get this straight, you don't have a drivers license or paperwork for this van?"" 

""Of course I do. My license is in my wallet in my back pocket. The paperwork for the van is in the glove compartment."" 

The supervisor, confused, sees that everything is in order just as the man said, and also discovers at that point that there are absolutely no drugs in the van.

""The officer that pulled you over said you had no license, no paperwork, and you were driving a stolen van full of drugs. What's going on here?""

The man, feigning surprise, looked at the supervisor and said,

"These aliens are a war-like people who enjoy conquering and enslaving other races.  They like putting on warpaint, doing war dances, shouting out war chants, and other pre-battle rituals.  One of their favored methods to declare war on a planet is to take some of the local flora and fauna of a world and violate those living things in front of the world's leaders.  This acts as a metaphor to symbolize that their whole world will soon be similarly violated.

One day these aliens come to Earth.  Identifying America as the nation with the most powerful military, the aliens touch down on the White House lawn.  The President's Secret Service surrounds the craft and they are promptly slaughtered by the aliens.  The Army is called but they, too, fall to the aliens' superior numbers.  The Navy and Air Force try to strike back but they are too technologically inferior to do anything.  The aliens burn the White House to the ground and sack Washington DC.  They incinerate the museums and kill the President's family, even his dog.  But this is but a small taste of what's to come for Earth.  

After all of this, the aliens decide it is time for their sacred ritual of declaring war.  As they begin to do their war dances and war chants, the chief alien finds some local flora in the form of a bag of peas in an abandoned grocery store.  Grabbing those peas, the alien chief violates those vegetables right in front of the President.  The peas, having come from the planet's soil, are an excellent metaphor to show the violation that will soon await the whole Earth.

""We come in peas!"" the chief screams defiantly to the President, greeted by thousands of fanatical cheers from his loyal followers.

"A young man was lost wandering in a forest, when he came upon a small house. He knocked on the door and was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, grey beard. ""I'm lost,"" said the man. ""Can you put me up for the night?"" 

""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man."" 

""Ok,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. 

Before dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful, and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man since she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy. 

He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest."" 

""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" 

In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder.

While waiting they began to wonder; Could they possibly get married in Heaven?  
When St. Peter arrived they asked him if they could get married in Heaven.  
St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he left.  
The couple sat and waited for an answer.... for a couple of months.  
While they waited, they discussed the pros and cons. If they were allowed to get married in Heaven, should they get married, what with the eternal aspect of it all?  
What if it doesn't work? Are we stuck in Heaven together forever?'  
Another month passed. St. Peter finally returned, looking somewhat bedraggled.  
“Yes,' he informed the couple, 'You can get married in Heaven.'  
'Great!' said the couple. 'But we were just wondering; what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'

"There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

The executioner was speechless.

During his chick years he was so hardworking and competitive that he was always top of the class and graduated a couple of months younger than his peers. Of course, naturally he was accepted to prestigious Universities by the time he was eligible. He studied economics and then directly pursued law. He topped the bar exam and started his own firm, Chic & Ken, with an older successful rooster. It became the most prestigious firm in the entire farm. At this time as well, because the law allows it, he wed many lovely hens and fathered many healthy eggs. One dawn, he went out a little earlier than his usual time to crow. The moon was very round and seeing himself being the only animal awake, he started to contemplate about his life. He asked himself why was he so blessed in life and why did it feel like he never had a setback. How good life was if he could live forever. Unknown to him, his wish would be granted but it would be the start of a tragedy. The next day, his firm was the centerpiece of the biggest scandal in history and he found out that his partner was working closely with terrorists. Within two days, Chic & Ken was no more and he had to move his entire family to another smaller coop. He had to look other jobs to support such a big family and he went to the stable, and the garden, but no one would dare hire him. At nightfall he went back to his home but to his horror, his wives and their brood were massacred by foxes; he had just caught a glimpse of their tails when they were fleeing the scene.

One day, he came up to a busy highway when suddenly a fairy appeared and said to him that he was cursed to live forever but today it has finally been lifted.

The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over $100 billion.

The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating.

The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish. First guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.

Second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him.

Third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.

The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.

First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.

Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already.

Third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" Second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds.

"Yadiks was a womaniser known throughout the lands with the ability to have sex with any woman he wants. One day his friends bet him a thousand dollars that he can't fuck the governor's daughter for three weeks straight so he takes on the challenge. And so, he went to the governor's house, grabbed a hose and started watering the plants, after a few minutes the governor finds and asks him what he's doing and so the young man says: ""oh mister governor I've been your fan for a long time, I voted for you in every election and have been supporting you for years now, but for these past few months I haven't had any sustainable income so I was just looking for odd jobs and noticed your plants are wilting away, I was thinking I would water them for you without a hitch but since you're here I wanted to ask if you could spare me a bottle of soda since I haven't had a sip of it for months now"".
The governor, feeling bad for the young man said: "" go in the house to my daughter and tell her to give you a bottle, and my Gardner has had an injury so if you want you can replace him until he comes back, I'll pay you with food or water for everyday you work here."" And so, yadiks goes up to the daughter's room and tells her: ""your father said you need to give me your virginity"", suspicious, she learns out the window and says: "" daddy, should I really give it to this guy ? You don't even know him."" But the governor assured her that it's fine and he can have it since he works here now, and so the two make love for half an hour and the young man leaves. And this chain of events keeps happening on a daily basis until, after a month has passed, the governor heard a small squeak that resembled his daughter's voice. thinking about it, he pieces everything together and realised that the new gardener he hired was actually having sex with his daughter. Instantly he called his bodyguards and went to his daughter's room where he found the couple happily in bed. In a fit of rage, he said: guards, grab yadiks and beat the shit out of 'em"".

"This triangular lake was quite large; so large, in fact, that three separate kingdoms were built on each side of this lake. These kingdoms were very different one from another.
The first kingdom was the richest - smooth stone walls built like a fortress, lavish houses for all, and a generous king who made the lives of his townsfolk quite enjoyable. They had want for nothing, for they had many riches.
The second kingdom wasn't as fine - its outer walls of cobblestone and wood held the middle-class villagers, who had to slap on some elbow grease once in a while to get things done.
But the third kingdom was the most desolate of all - rotting walls of wood housed the peasants, farmers and slaves. Ridden with disease and dirt, one's dream house would be anywhere but here.

One day, the king of the first kingdom decides he wants the lake, for it is a valuable resource, and so he wages war on the other two kingdoms over the lake; winner takes all.
For such a war, the first kingdom sends out a hundred war-trained knights clad in the finest steel armor you've ever seen with polished swords and armored stallions of battle. To accompany them, a squire is assigned to each knight to tend to his every need, no matter how demanding.
The second kingdom, since they're not as wealthy as the first, sends out fifty knights with top-notch leather armor and a few horses, as well as two dozen squires for the lot.
The third kingdom sends out its only warrior with the suit of armor his father passed down to him when he died of smallpox. Seeing as said warrior is quite elderly, they task their king's only squire to him to aid him in his endeavours.

The night before the battle, the first kingdom's knights have a huge party. They get drunk off their asses with wine and mead, and everyone has one hell of a night.
The second kingdom's knights don't have such luxuries, so they sit around a large fire with pints of ale and recount battle-won victories of the past, with the squires offering music and dancing for entertainment.
The third kingdom's lone knight decides he's not in the mood to party since he's way past 50, and has a small beer before nodding off under a tree. The squire makes him beef stew in a pot, and hoists it up in the tree with a noose around a thick branch to consume it for breakfast before their battle.

The sun rises, roosters crow, and the knights awaken. The first kingdom's knights all have head-splitting migraines from their hangovers; the second kingdom's knights aren't doing that well either; the third kingdom's knight slept in. They collectively decide that no one's in the mood to wield a sword and kill anyone, so the three kingdoms send their squires out to battle. And what a battle! Blood was spilled, skulls were shattered, enemies were slain, and against all odds, the lone survivor of this massacre was the lone squire from the third kingdom. As was agreed by the three kings, the third kingdom was given the lake.

I suppose it goes to show that the squire of the high-pot-and-noose is equal to the squires of its two opposing sides.","In Medieval Europe, there once was a triangular lake.",9cpsm6,new

The father was a little disturbed by the last part but shook it off and went to bed.

The next day, the father was in complete shock to hear of his father-in-law's passing. He thought about what his daughter said but dismissed it as a brutal coincidence.

That same night he tucked his daughter to bed and she said - ""Goodnight Mom, goodnight Dad, goodbye forever Grandmommy"" 

Again the father felt disturbed by that last part but thought that lightning wouldn't strike in the same place twice.

The next morning he gets a call saying that his mother had passed away in her sleep. 

The father [understandably] was speechless.

On the third night, as he tucked his daughter to bed she said - ""Goodnight Mom, goodbye forever Dad""

The father shat himself and wouldn't take any chances. The next morning he gathered supplies and he rushed to his office. He promised to lock himself in his office until midnight to avoid death.
